How Chinese scholars think about Chinese foreign policy.,"Feng, Huiyun; He, Kai",Australian Journal of Political Science,16-Dec,Taylor & Francis Ltd,INTERNATIONAL relations -- Study & teaching; INTERNATIONAL relations; CHINA -- Foreign relations; STRUCTURAL equation modeling; ASIA-United States relations; RESEARCH,assertiveness; China; international relations; IR scholars; opinion survey,"China’s assertive diplomacy in recent years has ignited intense debates among international relations (IR) scholars. Some argue that China’s assertive behaviour is rooted in its perception of increasing power and capabilities. Others suggest that it is US policies that triggered China’s assertive reactions. Relying on an original survey of China’s IR scholars conducted in Beijing in 2013 and using structural equation modelling, we empirically examine Chinese IR scholars’ attitude towards Chinese power versus the United States, their perceptions of US policy in Asia, and their preference for an assertive Chinese foreign policy. We find that both the power perception and policy reaction arguments make sense in accounting for Chinese IR scholars’ attitude regarding China’s assertive diplomacy. However, our research suggests that a more pessimistic view on Chinese power is more likely to be associated with a preference for an assertive foreign policy.

How Do Americans Evaluate China's International Responsibility? An Empirical Assessment.,"Li, Shoushi; Ye, Luofu",Journal of Contemporary China,15-Mar,Taylor & Francis Ltd,PUBLIC opinion; INTERNATIONAL obligations; SOFT power (Social sciences); HUMAN rights; POWER (Social sciences); SURVEYS; POLITICAL systems; GREAT powers (International relations); INTERNATIONAL relations; UNITED States; CHINA -- Foreign relations -- 1976-; CHINA; CHINA -- Politics & government -- 2002-; CHINA -- Foreign economic relations,,"China in recent years has been asked by other major powers to take a greater share in international responsibility in response to the rise in China's national capability. Negative perceptions about how China is dodging its international responsibility exist not only among policy makers around the world, but have spread to worldwide mass publics, especially across the American people. In this article, we apply the dataset from the ‘Americans’ Attitudes toward China Survey' (AACS) to investigate what the American public think of China's international responsibility and which factors explain the varying evaluations from different theoretical perspectives. The results indicate that Americans' negative evaluations of China's international responsibility are associated with poor ratings regarding China's fulfillment of its domestic obligations and apprehension regarding China's potential threat, but has little to do with China's international behavior. To reduce these negative evaluations, China needs to improve its human rights conditions, give people more political rights, and convince the American public of the benevolence of its ascending power. In addition, persistent efforts toward soft-power construction are also very important since Americans who are interested in Chinese culture or knowledge tend not to think that China is dodging its international responsibility.

How Do Americans View the Rising China?,"Aldrich, John; Lu, Jie; Kang, Liu",Journal of Contemporary China,15-Mar,Taylor & Francis Ltd,PUBLIC opinion; POWER (Social sciences); CULTURE; INTERNATIONAL relations; DEMOCRATS' attitudes; PARTISANSHIP; POLITICAL doctrines; SURVEYS; CHINA; UNITED States; CHINA -- Politics & government -- 2002-; AMERICAN attitudes; TOURISM; CHINA-United States relations,,"The dramatic increase in China's economic and hence political power and influence is a common story around the world. Just how clearly and well does this story get across to citizens of some nations other than China, itself? In particular, we ask what Americans know about China. Do they observe its rise? Are their views simple or rich and nuanced? How do they vary across the public? What leads to more positive and what leads to more negative views of China? We report the results of a survey of the American population designed to address these questions. We find that they are reasonably knowledgeable of China's rise and that they have rich and nuanced perceptions of a variety of dimensions of China, its society, economy and polity. These views are, on balance, not especially positive, but the more cosmopolitan the citizen, the more likely they are to hold positive views. Those who are Democrats, who are liberals, and who have had the opportunity to travel in China are especially likely to have positive impressions.

"How Hawkish Is the Chinese Public? Another Look at ""Rising Nationalism"" and Chinese Foreign Policy.","Weiss, Jessica Chen",Journal of Contemporary China,19-Sep,Taylor & Francis Ltd,NATIONALISM; PUBLIC opinion; INTERNATIONAL relations; NATIONAL security -- Law & legislation; CHINA; CHINA -- Foreign relations; CHINESE military,,"Chinese leaders often invoke the feelings of the Chinese people in international disputes. However, most survey research on Chinese public opinion on international affairs has looked at measures of nationalist identity rather than beliefs about foreign policy and evaluations of the government's performance. Five surveys of Chinese citizens, netizens, and elites help illuminate the attitudes that the Chinese government grapples with in managing international security policy. The results suggest that Chinese attitudes are more hawkish than dovish and that younger Chinese, while perhaps not more nationalist in identity, may be more hawkish in their foreign policy beliefs than older generations. Netizens and elites are even more inclined to call on the Chinese government to invest in and rely more on military strength.

How New and Assertive Is China's New Assertiveness?,"Johnston, Alastair Iain",International Security,Spring2013,MIT Press,DIPLOMACY; INTERNATIONAL security; INTERNATIONAL relations; CHINA; CHINA -- Foreign relations -- 1976-; MEMES,,"There has been a rapidly spreading meme in U.S. pundit and academic circles since 2010 that describes China's recent diplomacy as ""newly assertive."" This ""new assertiveness"" meme suffers from two problems. First, it underestimates the complexity of key episodes in Chinese diplomacy in 2010 and overestimates the amount of change. Second, the explanations for the new assertiveness claim suffer from unclear causal mechanisms and lack comparative rigor that would better contextualize China's diplomacy in 2010. An examination of seven cases in Chinese diplomacy at the heart of the new assertiveness meme finds that, in some instances, China's policy has not changed; in others, it is actually more moderate; and in still others, it is a predictable reaction to changed external conditions. In only one case--maritime disputes--does one see more assertive Chinese rhetoric and behavior. The speed and extent with which the newly assertive meme has emerged point to an understudied issue in international relations--namely, the role that online media and the blogosphere play in the creation of conventional wisdoms that might, in turn, constrain policy debates. The assertive China discourse may be a harbinger of this effect as a Sino-U.S. security dilemma emerges.

How Not To Be Abandoned by China: North Korea's Nuclear Brinkmanship Revisited.,Hongseo Park; Jae Jeok Park,Korean Journal of Defense Analysis,17-Sep,Korea Institute for Defense Analyses,BRINKMANSHIP; GOVERNMENT policy; INTERNATIONAL relations; DIPLOMACY; PROFIT,Alliance Security Dilemma; Brinkmanship; Korean Peninsula; North Korea; North Korea-China Relations,"Whatever motivations lie behind North Korea's nuclear and missile programs, North Korea has been aware that further nuclear and missile tests would incur increasingly harsh international sanctions. In order to survive the sanctions, North Korea needs to entrap China to its side, for the North Korean economy is highly dependent upon China. In this context, this article argues that North Korea intentionally increases the level of its nuclear and missile threat in order to entrap China (thus, reducing its fear of being abandoned by China). That is. North Korea has elaborated its coercive diplomacy in order to press China to show a strong commitment to their mutual alliance. In order to develop the above argument, this article proceeds as follows. First, as an analytical framework, it applies Glenn Snyder's concept of the linkage between the alliance game and adversary game to the trilateral relationship among the United States (along with South Korea), China and North Korea. Second, it provides an overview of Sino-North Korean relations from 2006 up to the present, attempting to analyze North Korea's brinkmanship. Thirdly, it concludes with some policy implications for future trilateral relations, one of which is that China should seriously discuss North Korea contingency plans with the United States and South Korea in order to develop an effective strategy to curb North Korea's military adventurism. Paradoxically, this would lead to North Korea's fully considering China's position.

How Oil Influences U.S. National Security.,"Glaser, Charles L.",International Security,Fall2013,MIT Press,NATIONAL security; ENERGY security; MILITARY policy; ENERGY consumption; INTERNATIONAL relations; UNITED States; CHINA,,"How do states' oil requirements influence U.S. national security? Although a great deal of attention has focused on ""energy security,"" scholars and policymakers lack satisfactory answers because little analysis links states' energy requirements with the probability of military conflict. Developing an analytic catalogue of the ways in which states' oil requirements could influence U.S. national security is the first step in closing this gap. Possible mechanisms include vulnerable access to oil that threatens a state's military capability; military policies designed to protect access to oil that threaten another state's military capability, which in turn create an access-driven security dilemma; and oil reserves that increase the value of territory, generating a conflict that draws in the United States via an alliance commitment. A distinctive feature of this framework is that some of these mechanisms identify threats to U.S. security that flow from another country's consumption of oil, not from U.S. consumption. Of particular importance is the potential danger that Chinese oil imports create for U.S. security--China's efforts to protect its sea lines of communication are fueling military competition that could strain U.S.-China relations and increase the probability of conflict between them. Policy options for dealing with these dangers share little with the standard options prescribed for dealing with the dangers related to Persian Gulf oil and U.S. oil consumption.

Hybrid interference as a wedge strategy: a theory of external interference in liberal democracy.,"Wigell, Mikael",International Affairs,19-Mar,Oxford University Press / USA,IRREGULAR warfare; INTERVENTION (International law); DEMOCRACY; LIBERALISM; DIPLOMACY; INTERNATIONAL relations,China; democratization; East–West relations; grand strategy; international security; Russia,"'Hybridity' is in vogue these days. Yet, the utility of the hybrid label is often contested in security studies. A problem relates to how the concept of hybrid warfare has been extended to cases that have little in common with the cases from which the concept was originally derived. This article suggests making a conceptual distinction between hybrid warfare and hybrid interference. The article is devoted to developing this latter, new strategic concept. In essence, hybrid interference is conceptualized as a 'wedge strategy', namely a policy of dividing a target country or coalition, thereby weakening its counterbalancing potential. By drawing particularly on recent practices by China and Russia, the article shows how hybrid interference uses a panoply of state-controlled, non-kinetic means, which are more or less concealed in order to provide the divider with plausible deniability and to control targeted actors without elevating their threat perceptions. Three main bundles of means are central to hybrid interference: 1) clandestine diplomacy; 2) geoeconomics; and 3) disinformation. The article shows how western democracies are vulnerable to hybrid interference. Hybrid interference makes use of the liberal values that characterize western democracy, exploiting them as opportunities to drive wedges through democratic societies and undermine governability. The article argues that this sort of external interference has been overlooked in the debate on democratic deconsolidation, that it is becoming more common, and discusses some counter-measures to defend against it.

Impact of the China–Pakistan Economic Corridor on Nation-Building in Pakistan.,"Ahmed, Zahid Shahab",Journal of Contemporary China,19-May,Taylor & Francis Ltd,INTERNATIONAL economic relations; GEOPOLITICS; ECONOMIC development; FOREIGN investments; CHINA -- Foreign relations; PAKISTAN -- Foreign relations,,"Since the beginning of bilateral ties in 1950, the China–Pakistan relationship has grown significantly. Known as Pakistan's 'all-weather friend', bilateral economic cooperation has been advanced by the China–Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) agreement, worth US$62 billion of Chinese investment in Pakistan. Due to its geo-economic and geopolitical importance, the CPEC is considered a 'game changer' by Beijing and Islamabad. However, since its initiation in 2015, the CPEC has also been a source of tension between centre and provincial governments in Pakistan. This paper analyses the impact of the CPEC on nation-building in Pakistan. In the light of nation-building theories, it further argues that the CPEC has provided Pakistan with much-needed opportunities to address inter-provincial and federal–provincial discord through dialogue and compromises.

In from the margins? The changing place of Africa in International Relations.,"HARMAN, SOPHIE; BROWN, WILLIAM",International Affairs,13-Jan,Oxford University Press / USA,"INTERNATIONAL relations; INTERNATIONAL relations theory; GOVERNMENT policy; HISTORY; CHINA; AFRICA; CONGO (Democratic Republic); UN Millennium Project; AFRICAN Union; AIDS -- Africa; AFRICA -- Foreign relations -- 1960-; HIV; 1997-; JONES, Gruffydd",,"This article surveys recent literature on Africa and International Relations (IR) and reviews the current place of Africa within the discipline. It notes that critical debates continue around claims of a mismatch between Africa and 'mainstream' IR theories and concepts. However, alongside this set of issues, there is in fact a burgeoning literature on many aspects of Africa's international relations. While some of these studies utilize existing IR theories, and others explore empirical cases that could deliver important lessons for the wider discipline, much of this promise goes unfulfilled. The article reviews literature on China's role and on HIV/AIDS governance in Africa to illustrate how the study of African international relations, the wider IR discipline and international policy could all benefit from a closer engagement between Africa and IR. The article concludes by setting out three challenges for a renewed agenda: a need to address the problematic relationship between universal analytical concepts and regional particularities; a need to give recognition to, and analyse, African agency in international politics; and a need to address inequalities in knowledge production in the field of Africa's international relations.

In the shadow of Marco Polo: writing about China in fascist Italy.,"De Giorgi, Laura",Journal of Modern Italian Studies,10-Sep,Taylor & Francis Ltd,"INTERNATIONAL relations; CULTURAL policy; NATIONALISM; NATION building; FASCISM; POLITICS & culture; CHINA; TRAVEL writing; CHINA -- Description & travel; BOXER Rebellion, China, 1899-1901; BARZINI, Luigi",China; cultural policy; Fascism; international relations; journalism; travel literature,"This paper explores the writings on contemporary China in the 1920s and 1930s of Italian scholars, journalists and travellers. The turning point in Italian interest in Chinese events was represented by Italy's participation in the Boxer Rebellion, narrated in Italy by Luigi Barzini. As of the late 1920s, attention was refocused on China, propelled by interest in Chinese nationalism and its state-building process and the new Fascist foreign policy approach to Asia. Books by fascist journalists and propagandists as well as essays written by several scholars and diplomats and published under the auspices of government scientific institutions all testify to the double effort to understand Chinese politics and culture on new terms and to imagine a more important role for Italy in China as a result of her alleged special historical relationship with the 'Orient'. However, this effort to promote a better knowledge of China was subordinated to contingent interests and choices and reflected the inconsistency of Fascist Italy's policy towards Asia. The aim of this paper is to shed light on the complex interplay of political and cultural factors behind the writings concerned with Italian and Chinese relations during those decades.

Increasing U.S.-China Strategic Competition: Implications for Pakistan.,"Amin, Fouzia; Khan, Khurshid",Korean Journal of Defense Analysis,17-Sep,Korea Institute for Defense Analyses,INTERNATIONAL relations; DEMOCRACY; NATIONAL security; DECISION making; AUTHORITARIANISM,apprehensive; complex economic interdependency; confrontation; great power; maritime capability; soft power; strategic alliance,"Historically. China had been a great power and had maintained the largest economy in the world for quite a long time. It would, therefore, like to regain its lost status. There is consensus among many scholars that China would rise peacefully by adopting the five ""principles of peaceful co-existence"", thus, it would take a leading role in the 21st century. It is viewed that the United States is already convinced to a great extent that it might not be able to maintain sole dominance for too long in the backdrop of the rising Chinese economic and military power. Based on an in-depth analysis of the issue, the study concludes that China would avoid clashing with Washington and its allies while protecting its economic interests across the globe. Nevertheless, the Chinese would react if their core interests are threatened by the United States and its allies including India. In order to protect its long-tenn interest in the region and beyond. China would gradually develop its military including its maritime capabilities to increase its influence beyond China's periphery. However; it is highly unlikely that in the near future. China would contest the United States and its allies beyond the South China Sea. The study also concludes that in this great ongoing game between the quadrangles of the countries, if India makes a principle decision to stand by the United States in the case of a conflict with China over the Indian Ocean, such a scenario would limit Pakistan's options to either join China or stay neutral. Either of the two options would pose a serious challenge for Pakistan. A decision to stay outside the Great Powers' power politics would be even more difficult.

India is renewing its age-old links with East Asia; after a long hiatus it is looking to East Asia once again to engage with it more purposely. Compelled by political and economic imperatives, New Delhi launched the 'Look East' policy in the early 1990s, which, despite its slow take-off, has evolved into a comprehensive engagement underpinned by several politicalinstitutional mechanisms, strong economic association through a variety of comprehensive cooperation agreements, and robust defence links and security cooperation. As a result, India has now become an inalienable part of the evolving East Asian economic and security order. While India closely collaborates with the U.S., Japan and a few ASEAN countries in the management of regional security, India's relations with China are undergoing major changes as they become increasingly complex.

Nevertheless, bilateral trade interests converged while security interests diverged. Beijing adopted offensive realism while New Delhi followed defensive realism. When both confronted a 73-day military stand-off in Doklam, unexpectedly India demonstrated a miscellany of offensive realism whereas China constrained itself to defensive realism. Analysis establishes that they permeated their national characteristics while pursuing respective forms of realism. This article traces the trajectory of idealist versus realist perspectives that India has initiated to counter Chinese realism, analyses the two countries’ offensive-defensive postures during the Doklam stand-off, and examines the specific national characteristics that both countries brought to realism.

While India often stood for high moral grounds and promotion of democracy, it did so at the cost of losing Myanmar to China. This affected both India and Myanmar adversely: while New Delhi’s economic, energy and security interests were hurt, isolated Yangon became more China-dependent. However, since the early 1990s, domestic developments in Myanmar and post-Cold War structural changes in the world order necessitated conditions for cooperation and mutual gains. It appears that blatant domestic suppression in, and international seclusion of, Myanmar is not desirable. Having witnessed two eras of magnanimity and mistrust, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh’s visit to Myanmar in 2012 heralds a prospective era of market interdependence while opening Pandora’s box: can India get a better share of Myanmar’s commercial possibilities without compromising its core interests in promoting democracy, development and diaspora protection?

India's Counter-Terrorism Diplomacy Towards China: Issues and Trends.,"Kaura, Vinay",IUP Journal of International Relations,19-Jan,IUP Publications,"COUNTERTERRORISM; INTERNATIONAL relations; ASEAN; GREAT Britain. Joint Intelligence Committee; MODI, Narendra, 1950-",,"India's policy towards China has been to limit military tensions on the contested border through expanded bilateral economic engagement, high-level political contacts and enhanced multilateral cooperation on international issues. Counter-terrorism diplomacy is one such instrument, which has been viewed by India as an important diplomatic tool to convince China about the dangers of terrorism emanating from Pakistan. But China's uncooperative attitude towards India by repeatedly undermining the Modi government's diplomatic efforts to pressurize Pakistan has raised serious doubts about India's counter-terror diplomatic engagement with China. For India, the main source of terrorism is Pakistan. For China, Pakistan is its all-weather friend. Beijing's selective characterization of terrorist threat poses several challenges to the success of India's counter-terrorism efforts. Consequently, India has not been able to cope with Pakistan's asymmetric strategy of using terrorism, as Pakistan continues to mobilize China's unconditional help to ward off India's pressure.

One of Indian Premier Jawaharlal Nehru's closest political confidantes, Menon served variously as India's High Commissioner to the United Kingdom, leader of its delegation to the United Nations, self-styled mediator in the Korea, Indo-China, and Suez crises of the 1950s and, from 1957, his country's Defence Minister. Vilified in the West as 'India's Rasputin,' Menon's left-wing credentials, anti-colonial rhetoric, and willingness to engage with the Communist bloc were seen by Anglo-American diplomats as a threat to Western interests in South Asia. Drawing upon recently released British and American archival records, this article argues that Western misperceptions of Menon, and his role in the Indian foreign policy-making process, undermined Anglo-American relations with India for much of the early Cold War.

India's role in the South China Sea is four-fold: first, naval deployments; second, increasing strategic-military links with littoral states like Singapore, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Vietnam; third, economic involvement of Indian energy companies in South China Sea waters; and fourth, discussions between India and other regional and extra-regional China-concerned powers about the South China Sea.

Reasons for these changes include the changing nature of Indonesian politics, Indonesia's position in between the US and China, and the direct results of China's policy and behaviour. In turn, sectors of Indonesian society, Indonesian business communities and the government have reacted differently and at different times to China and its growing influence.

Indonesia's South China Sea Diplomacy: A Foreign Policy Illiberal Turn?,"McRae, Dave",Journal of Contemporary Asia,19-Dec,Taylor & Francis Ltd,DIPLOMACY; INTERNATIONAL relations; COALITIONS; NATIONALISM; SOUTH China Sea; INDONESIA -- Social conditions,democratisation; foreign policy; illiberalism; Indonesia; South China Sea,"Key areas of Indonesian foreign policy have remained largely autonomous of the political struggles associated with democratisation and a subsequent illiberal turn, even as they have changed the way foreign policy is formulated. Indonesia's South China Sea diplomacy has been one such area of autonomy. Although the issue has gained great public salience, as the most prominent foreign policy challenge for the current Joko Widodo administration, the government has maintained a striking continuity in its approach dating to the authoritarian Suharto era. Such continuity persists because the strategic challenge facing Indonesia has endured: throughout Indonesia's modern history, the government has sought to assert the nation's rights to territory and resources against more powerful states. The government's current policy settings have also preserved a status quo that serves a range of Indonesian interests sufficiently well to prevent the emergence of a coherent coalition of interests to push for a new approach, in what is a technical policy area dominated by foreign ministry experts. As such, although the Joko Widodo administration has exhibited greater overt nationalism in its handling of the issue, Indonesia's broader illiberal turn has not been transformative of the government's diplomacy.

Congress; INDIA-United States relations; TWENTY-first century; MODI, Narendra, 1950-",,"This article examines the transformation in Indo-US relations in the first two years of the Modi government. It first discusses the state of Indo-US relations before Modi's ascent to the premiership in May 2014. The challenges confronting the relationship were not strictly bilateral; Modi's image and its historical baggage had also made them personal. Subsequently, the article elaborates on the significant progress made in the bilateral relationship during the first two years of the Modi government. The concluding section explains the rationale behind Modi's outreach to the United States. Three factors appear to have had a significant influence: a conviction that India's developmental priorities cannot be met without substantive cooperation with the US; the strong political authority Modi enjoys within his own party and in the Indian parliament; and the structural changes in India's security environment brought about by an aggressive China and its growing strategic convergence with Pakistan, leading to a re-think on 'non-alignment' as a guiding principle of foreign policy.

We conduct original survey experiments in China and the United States and provide strong evidence that individual policy opinions about sector-specific trade protection depend on the earnings of workers in the sector. We also present structural estimates that advantageous and disadvantageous inequality influence support for trade protection in the two countries.

There is generally asymmetry of interests—the principal reason why the SCO's strategic situation is largely a suasion game between China and the members—with China demonstrating a greater interest in the SCO; moreover, the power asymmetry between China and the Central Asian members and the power equality between China and Russia further complicates the situation. This sophisticated relationship implies that despite some measurable results, the SCO faces tremendous challenges in becoming a well-established regional organization.

While the outcome of this is still unclear, this article argues that there are at least four areas in which the project of international development is changing. First, there is a debate, especially within the World Bank, about development strategy and how we think about development, particularly in terms of the balance between states and markets. This is evident in the debate over state failure and the new structural economics. Second, there is increasing evidence of a shift in lending, away from projects of 'small' human development, perhaps best encapsulated by the United Nations Millennium Development Goals, towards more transformative 'big' development projects such as infrastructure. Third, 'non-traditional' aid donors and new forms of private philanthropy are playing a more significant role in development financing and this, in turn, offers developing countries a new range of choices about what kinds of development assistance they receive. Fourth, aid relations are changing as a result of the renewed agency of developing states, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, and shifts towards increased South-South cooperation are growing as evidenced by increased funding from regional development banks and increased trade flows. The article reviews these changes and suggests a series of questions and challenges that arise from them for analysts of international development, developing countries and traditional aid donors.

However, with the acceleration of globalization, a dimension of legitimacy has come into view that has previously been largely neglected in political science: the international dimension. While the interdependence of nation-states at the global level might put some constraints on the (re)production of legitimacy domestically, it simultaneously allows them to leverage their global standing to gain legitimacy abroad and at home. China is the most prominent example of the growing importance of this dynamic link between internal and external legitimacy. The paper starts with a critical reflection on the prevalent Western legitimacy theories. Based on these reflections, it introduces a new approach which aims to differentiate analytically between internal and external legitimation strategies and to examine the two-level logic linking the two.

At the same time, they tend to relax these assumptions when analyzing China as an international actor. The thesis of this article is that domestic institutional fragmentation in Chinese bureaucratic politics carries over into its international behavior. Using the historical case of Chinese foreign assistance to Democratic Kampuchea, this article demonstrates that the effectiveness of Chinese foreign aid--and the influence that comes with it--is only as good as the domestic institutions that manage the bilateral relationship. This has implications for understanding the veracity of Chinese global influence today as well as refocusing attention to the domestic constraints on Beijing's international behavior.

We develop a game-theoretic model of persuasion that applies regardless of regime type and does not rely on the existence of domestic constituency constraints. In the model, an international organization (IO) and a domestic expert have private information about a crisis, but their preferences diverge from those of the government, which must choose whether to delegate decision making to the expert. Persuasion can take place if the international institution is able to send a credible signal. We find that this can take place only if the preferences of the IO and the domestic expert diverge and the institution holds the more moderate policy position. This result contrasts with conventional wisdom, which holds that the necessary condition for IOs to exert influence is support from a domestic constituency with aligned preferences. Our model suggests that, far from being an obstacle to international cooperation, polarized domestic politics may be a necessary condition for IOs to exert effective influence.

International Relations studies in Asia: distinctive trajectories.,"Alagappa, Muthiah",International Relations of the Asia-Pacific,11-May,Oxford University Press / USA,INTERNATIONAL relations; COMMERCIAL law; CHINA; INDIA; JAPAN,,"This article investigates and explains the development of International Relations studies (IRS) in China, Japan, and India. Beginning in early 1980s IRS experienced exponential growth in China and is becoming a separate discipline in that country. Despite early starts, IRS in Japan and India is still an appendage in other disciplinary departments, programs, and centers although growing interest is discernible in both countries. Continued rise of Asian powers along with their growing roles and responsibilities in constructing and managing regional and global orders is likely sustain and increase interest in IRS in these countries and more generally in Asia. Distinctive trajectories have characterized the development of IRS in China, Japan, and India. Distinctiveness is evident in master narratives and intellectual predispositions that have shaped research and teaching of IR in all three countries. The distinct IRS trajectories are explained by the national and international context of these countries as well as the extensiveness of state domination of their public spheres. Alterations in national circumstances and objectives along with changes in the international position explain the master narratives that have focused the efforts of IR research communities. Extensiveness of state domination and government support, respectively, explain intellectual predispositions and institutional opportunities for the development of IRS. IRS in Asia has had a predominantly practical orientation with emphasis on understanding and interpreting the world to forge suitable national responses. That orientation contributed to a strong emphasis on normative–ethical dimensions, as well as empirically grounded historical, area, and policy studies. For a number of reasons including intellectual predispositions and constraints, knowledge production in the positivist tradition has not been a priority. However, IR theorizing defined broadly is beginning to attract greater attention among Asian IR scholars. Initial interest in Western IR theory was largely a function of exposure of Asian scholars to Western (primarily American) scholarship that has been in the forefront in the development of IR concepts, theories, and paradigms. Emulation has traveled from copying to application and is now generating interest in developing indigenous ideas and perspectives based on national histories, experiences, and traditions. Although positivism may gain ground it is not deeply embedded in the intellectual traditions of Asian countries. Furthermore, theorizing in the positivist tradition has not made significant progress in the West where it is also encountering sharp criticism and alternative theories. Asian IR scholarship would continue to emphasize normative–ethical concerns. And historical, area, and policy studies would continue to be important in their own right, not simply as evidentiary basis for development of law-like propositions. It also appears likely that Asian IR scholarship would increasingly focus on recovery of indigenous ideas and traditions and their adaptation to contemporary circumstances. The net effect of these trends would be to diversify and enrich existing concepts, theories, methods, and perspectives, and possibly provide fresh ones as well. The flourishing of IRS in Asia would make the IR discipline more international.

First, the changing international environment, mostly with regard to the roles of the United States and the EU, challenged the established approach to foreign policy inherited from Deng Xiaoping, China’s pre-eminent leadership figure from the late 1970s to the mid-1990s. In this sense, the shift towards the EU was part of wider efforts to solve this dilemma. Second, differences in how various groups in the Chinese foreign policy establishment understood and implemented Deng’s guidelines and their respective influence in policy-making can help to grasp some of the more specific developments in Chinese policy towards the EU in the early 2000s. To supplement this main claim, the article also critically evaluates the changes less well explained by these two dynamics and proposes additional explanations.

In the past Chinese and foreigners alike have seen China's foreign policies through the lens of history, but recent Chinese stress on the 'harmonious world' resulting from Confucianism has shifted the discussion. It serves as a guide to resurgent claims for leadership, a source of legitimation for why China deserves leadership, and a warning of how its leadership may be abused to the detriment of countries agreeing to regionalism or multilateralism. Claims to superiority raise tensions in Japan, South Korea, and elsewhere where hopes had existed for a shared view of history. They arouse controversy among advocates of socialist ideology who fear that Confucianism will eclipse communism. The increasingly hereditary elite of Party leaders continues to bridge the gap between these two types of memory, but they face an ideological challenge at home and a credibility challenge abroad.

The PRC got involved in such projects initially in 1979, and this intensified in 1990s. The history of such projects reveals how regional and non-regional actors have promoted a variety of visions for the configuration of Europe-Asia overland freight transport corridors in two historical periods: the years of the Cold War, and the years of the post-Cold War. I argue that, here, such projects aimed at connecting countries and continents while also excluding others, and to show how various global actors have historically seen—and still do so today—the establishment of such corridors through a technocratic lens, namely not only to promote intercultural exchanges, but to consolidate political and economic alliances across countries and continents by bridging the peoples of different nation-states but also civilisations.

Is China a Status Quo or Revisionist State?

Power transition theory highlights the potential for a dissatisfied rising power to challenge the existing international order, but it is difficult to evaluate whether a rising power is dissatisfied. Where Chinese leaders choose to travel can offer insights into whether China's behavior is more consistent with that of a revisionist or status quo state and into China's broader diplomatic priorities. We present a series of expectations concerning how the travel patterns of a challenger state are likely to differ from the travel patterns of a status quo state. Using a newly compiled data set, we then analyze the correlates of travel abroad by top Chinese leaders from 1998 to 2008. Our results are more consistent with a status quo conceptualization of China, though there are some important exceptions such as willingness to travel to rogue states. We also use travel data to test other hypotheses about Chinese foreign policy behavior.

Is China committed to peaceful rise? Debating how to secure core interests in China.,"Zeng, Jinghan",International Politics,17-Sep,Palgrave Macmillan Ltd.,NATIONAL security; INTERNATIONAL economic relations; CHINA -- Foreign relations; CHINA,China's rise; Chinese foreign policy; Core interests; National security strategy; Peaceful development,"With China's rise, many argue that its foreign policy has been increasingly assertive. A principal aspect of this assertiveness is to secure China's 'core interests'-a term that suggests a non-negotiable bottom line of Chinese foreign policy and has been increasingly used by the Chinese government to legitimate its diplomatic claim. Built on a previous study on how China perceives core interests, this article analyses how China aims to secure its core interests by using content analysis to study 108 Chinese academic articles concerning 'China's core interests'. It identifies six major suggestions to secure China's core interests: diplomacy, military cooperation, military modernization, economic cooperation, economic influence, and domestic reform. It finds that, when discussing how to secure China's core interests, diplomacy is still the most popular solution followed by the suggestion to develop a stronger military power. This article argues that the diverse (and sometimes contrary) views on China's national security strategy have made it difficult to predict and test the credibility of China's peaceful rise commitment.

Is the Chinese Government’s Increase in Development Co-operation with Africa the Revival of Sinocentrism?,"Park, Jinman",Geopolitics,Jul-Sep2015,Taylor & Francis Ltd,INTERNATIONAL cooperation; INTERNATIONAL relations; NATURAL resources; AFRICA; CHINA,,"Over the past few decades, the rapid growth of China’s development co-operation with Africa has attracted worldwide attention. Some people assert that development co-operation in Africa has contributed to the general development of the continent; however, others, many of whom are scholars and Western politicians, dispute its influence on Africa and are suspicious of its real motives, noting its exploitation of natural resources and increasing market encroachment. This study will discuss the expansion of China’s development co-operation with African countries from the perspective of Sinocentrism, as there appears to be an absence of a superordinate concept or ideology that extensively encompasses and interconnects the diverse explications from existing studies. Henceforth, this research aims to contribute towards examining whether Sinocentrism could be a possible superordinate concept of existing studies. As such, it could be helpful in better understanding Chinese development co-operation in Africa, by examining China’s history and its recent path in Africa as well as its international relations.

By the end of the 90s the combined pressures of Japan's stagnating economy and an emergent China showed the need of a reinvigorated strategy toward S.E.A. Primer Minister Junichiro Koizumi tried to bring about such a strategy and introduced new directions in two areas: security issues and economic partnership. Seven years after Koizumi, the new government of Shinzo Abe finds that the same geopolitical constraints of the late 90s are still alive.

Para finales de los años 90, las presiones combinadas de una economía estancada y una China emergente, mostraban la necesidad de una estrategia más activa hacia el Sureste Asiático. El primer ministro Junichiro Koizumi trató de plasmar tal estrategia e introdujo dos nuevas direcciones en dos áreas determinadas: asuntos de seguridad y asociación económica. Siete años después de Koizumi, el nuevo gobierno de Shinzo Abe se encuentra con que las mismas limitaciones geopolíticas de finales de los 90 se mantienen.

Japan's location is often divided between those arguing that Japan is inside Asia and those arguing it is outside Asia. Japanese ideas of Asian regionalism are thus immensely varied. This article details a number of Japanese ideas on Asian regionalism with author/agency, scope and method specified. Special mention is made of weak integration of government agencies, thus causing proliferation of many Japanese ideas within Asia. With the increasing self-assertiveness of China, the apparent peaking out of American hegemony, and the steady rise of non-Chinese Asians, Japan tries to maintain enduring alliance with the United States, to invigorate interdependence with China, and to reinvent new relationships with the countries of the East Asian Summit. Japanese ideas of Asian regionalism take those templates as guidelines to develop new ideas of Asian regionalism.

More recently, the nadir following India's nuclear testing in 1998 was followed by significantly improved relations in the early 2000s, with the relationship reaching its post-war best in most areas when Abe Shinzo (2006-07) was Japan's prime minister.

By making use of a narrative account and a variety of primary sources--including personal memoirs, elite interviews, participatory observation, and leaked State Department cables--this article finds that Abe Shinzo's foreign policy confidante, Yachi Shotaro, embodied the unmatched influence of government actors in Japan's political landscape. The article provides a close-up portrait of Yachi, with an emphasis on his preference for geopolitics, strategy, and secret diplomacy. Yachi and the institutional apparatus he represented sought detente with Japan's main strategic adversary, while pushing for geopolitical initiatives that targeted China. The article concludes by arguing that the Abe administration's insistence on, and institutionalized practice of, conducting public affairs in secret will likely further strengthen the role of the nation-state and of government actors in Japan, also in light of growing geopolitical tensions in East Asia.

Japan's new assertiveness: institutional change and Japan's securitization of China.,"Schulze, Kai",International Relations of the Asia-Pacific,18-May,Oxford University Press / USA,INTERNATIONAL relations; ASSERTIVENESS (Psychology); INSTITUTIONALISM (Religion); JAPAN -- Foreign relations; JAPAN -- Politics & government -- 1989-,,"In recent years, Japan's foreign policy elite has started to increasingly securitize China in their security discourse. The harsher tone from Tokyo is widely evaluated as a direct reaction to China's own assertive behavior since 2009/2010. Yet, the change in the Japanese government's rhetoric had started changing before 2010. In order to close this gap, the present article sheds light on an alternative causal variable that has been overlooked in the literature: a change in Japan's security institutions, more specifically, the upgrade of the Defense Agency to the Ministry of Defense, in 2007. While utilizing discursive institutionalism and securitization-approaches, the present article demonstrates that a strong correlation indeed exists between the institutional shift and the change in Japan's defense whitepapers in the 2007-10 period. It thus opens up a research avenue for the further scrutiny of the hitherto understudied but significant causal linkage in the study of contemporary Japanese security policy toward China.

Abe, a member of the Liberal Democratic Party, achieved a landslide election victory last December 2012. It notes that Abe, who served as a prime minister from 2006 to 2007, was able to regain his power by capitalising on growth nationalism and heightened sense of national-security threats among Japanese voters. Abe's return as prime minister post some concerns since its relationship with China and Korea is not stable.

Tokyo prepared to conduct exploratory drilling in the disputed East China Sea and passed new laws to permit the full realization of Japan's maritime rights and responsibilities. This activist turn appears to be at odds with most explanations of Japanese strategic policy. Given its preference for strategic evolution, Japan's sudden preoccupation with the security and administration of its extended maritime zones--the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and its extended continental shelf--following years of neglect is striking. Moreover, this shift has not received a great deal of attention in the literature. This paper argues that Japan's hesitant, ad hoc and incomplete response to its changing maritime environment can be understood through Kent Calder's ""reactive state"" paradigm. While academic discussion of Japanese foreign policy has moved beyond the reactive state debate, Japan's approach to its ocean policy appears to fulfill both of Kent Calder's reactive state criteria. This paper analyses Japan's resistance to the expansion of state sovereignty seaward and explores how this policy inertia was exposed by China's more active maritime policy. This more assertive Chinese posture triggered the proactive turn in Japan's ocean policy, which may have negative consequences for regional security.

Japan's Policy Toward China Under Strong Anti-Chinese Sentiment: A Case of Terminating Yen Loans to China.,"Sekiyama, Takashi",East Asia: An International Quarterly,12-Sep,Springer Nature,"INTERNATIONAL relations; INTERNATIONAL economic relations -- History; GOVERNMENT lending; XENOPHOBIA; CHINA; JAPAN; JAPANESE; CHINA-Japan relations; ATTITUDE (Psychology); YEN (Japanese currency); JAPAN -- Politics & government -- 1989-; MACHIMURA, Nobutaka; KOIZUMI, Jun'ichiro, 1942-; LI Zhaoxing",Anti-Chinese sentiment; China; Japan; ODA,"2004 was the year when the Japanese public's affinity with China dropped dramatically, to 37.6 %, due to anti-Japan riots in China. Now more than 70 % of the Japanese public does not feel an affinity with China. How could such a strong anti-Chinese sentiment influence Japan's policy toward China? This paper considers this question by examining Japan's decision-making process on terminating the much-criticized yen loans to China. Yen loans are a type of Official Development Assistance (ODA) provided by the Japanese government to countries lacking sufficient funds for economic development. China is one of the top yen loan borrowers, and the loans have contributed to China's economic growth and increasing openness. However, in March 2005, Japanese Foreign Minister Nobutaka Machimura told Chinese Foreign Minister Li Zhaoxing that Japan intended to phase out the yen loans before the 2008 Beijing Olympics and reached an agreement on the matter. Two-and-a-half years later, Japan terminated its yen loans to China, as the foreign ministers had agreed. Through mainly firsthand documents and interviews with government officials, this paper will clarify the following two points: (1) While it is true that the Japanese government significantly reduced its yen loan package to China from 2001 onward due to domestic criticism of China, as pointed out by previous studies, it was not planning to terminate the yen loans as of summer 2004. Instead, the Japanese government was contemplating how to keep providing yen loans to China; (2) Foreign Minister Nobutaka Machimura, who was appointed in September 2004, had pushed for the termination of yen loans to China only after anti-Chinese sentiment rose dramatically in summer 2004, because he felt that continuing the much-criticized yen loans would not benefit stable Japan-China relations. This paper sheds light on the background of the termination of yen loans to China, a major milestone in postwar Japan-China relations that had been unclear until now. Having said this, the more important point of this paper may be that it also shows the influence of strong anti-Chinese sentiment on Japan's policies toward China.

Journey to the West: China Debates Its ‘Great Power’ Identity.,"Suzuki, Shogo",Millennium (03058298),14-Jun,"Sage Publications, Ltd.",INTERNATIONAL relations; WORLD politics; IDEOLOGY; POLITICAL science; CHINA -- Foreign relations,‘Occidentalism’; China; great power identity; the West,"This article joins recent debates on China’s rise that claim the People’s Republic of China has become increasingly ‘assertive’. By examining discourses calling for China to emulate Western great powers, it demonstrates that there remains a powerful discourse within Chinese society which regards Western standards as the sole ‘benchmark’ for success and recognition in the international community. In doing so, the article introduces the concept of ‘Occidentalism’, which is a belief that a state’s identity is deeply connected to Western recognition, and which constructs a highly idealised and essentialised ‘Western Other’ to promote particular political reforms. The existence of ‘Occidentalism’ in domestic debates on China’s future as a great power demonstrates that claims of China’s ‘assertive turn’ are premature, and those who call for a more muscular Chinese foreign policy are one of many voices within Chinese political circles.

Our contention is that Kazakhstan's multi-vector foreign policy has mitigated Russia's concerns regarding security, status, and power in Central Asia, in this way removing or attenuating issues that could exacerbate Sino-Russian tensions. The study examines the concrete strategies employed by the Kazakh government to withstand pressures to submit to the influence of dominant states and alleviate tensions in Sino-Russian relations while simultaneously promoting its own interests.

This research mainly aims to explain ethnic preference in Korea's immigration policy through the lens of Korean nationalism. The influx of ethnic Koreans in China (or Joseonjok) since the early 1990s has created a new dilemma for the South Korean government, which has long claimed to be the only legitimate polity of the Korean nation. The discrepancy between the legal citizenship and ethnicity of the Korean- Chinese workers in Korean society has forced the Korean state to redefine both legal and discursive national boundaries. This study analyzes the bifurcation of the Korean state discourses regarding Korean- Chinese workers in Korean society.

Drawing on the articles in this special issue, our analysis also brings to the fore certain inadequacies in deliberative democracy as a framework for evaluating legislative disruption.

If the rise of China is inevitable, what will the future world look like, and what should other countries be prepared for? Borrowing insights from institutional balancing theory and role theory in foreign policy analysis, this project introduces a 'leadership transition' framework to explain policy dynamics in global governance, with the AIIB as a case study. It suggests that China, the United States, and other countries have employed different types of institutional balancing strategies, i.e. inclusive institutional balancing, exclusive institutional balancing, and inter-institutional balancing, to compete for influence and interest in the process of establishing the AIIB. A state's role identity as a 'leader', a 'challenger', or a 'follower' will shape its policy choices in global governance regarding different institutional balancing strategies in the process of 'leadership transition.' Institutional balancing is a new type of balancing among states in the future transformation of global governance. China's institutional rise in global governance, therefore, might be more peaceful than widely predicted.

Recognizing that its capacity and resolve are limited in ways that restrain its role in maritime deterrence outside north-east Asia, the Japanese government has focused on deploying 'soft security infrastructure' to advance its grand strategic designs. The government is also seeking to position Japanese businesses—and ultimately the Japanese economy—to take economic advantage of emerging production networks and the growing consumer base in 'emerging Asia'—as well as, increasingly, in east Africa, in order to reduce its economic dependence on China and the West. The Japanese government anticipates that promoting the development of horizontally integrated economic corridors throughout subregions in emerging Asia and east Africa will be advantageous to Japanese commercial interests as well as enhance Japan's capacity, and others', to resist Chinese economic and military coercion. Japan's grand strategy and pivot within Asia thus goes beyond reactive, short-term balancing behaviour. It is focused, in the long term, on drawing the centre of regional economic gravity away from China to enable Japan and other regional nations to exist and prosper on the outer rim of Chinese hegemony—and to actively contest it if necessary.

General Assembly; CHINA -- Politics & government -- 1949-,China; Leadership; Legitimacy; Multilateralism; United Nations,"This paper examines the likelihood of China’s legitimation as the global hegemon during an era of relative U.S. decline. Using Rapkin’s ( 1990 ) legitimacy deficit framework, the author tests China’s prospects for international legitimacy through the analysis of Chinese leadership at the United Nations (UN). While China’s recent exponential increase in contributions to UN peacekeeping and the UN regular budget signal growing Chinese global leadership, their consistent focus on regional interests, as displayed in UN Security Council and UN General Assembly debate and discussion, indicates the absence of an internationally supported agenda. In concluding, this paper asserts that recent Chinese legitimation efforts through UN leadership have been stonewalled by an inability to provide an international agenda with globally held values and beliefs.

This analysis examines the theory of out of character actions, focusing on shifting international conditions and the use of secrecy to allow leaders both to lead public opinion and avoid unwanted scrutiny. The plausibility of this theory is tested in the paradigmatic case for hawkish policy reversal: Richard Nixon’s rapprochement with China in 1971–1972. Examination of four facets of Sino–American relations—the Soviet dimension, conservative opposition to rapprochement, growing domestic support for improved relations, and the secrecy of negotiations—reveal the significance of contextual factors and Nixon’s decisions in explaining improved relations. Leaders can effectively change their type with minimal political repercussions, as long as conditions are favourable and audience costs can be minimised.

Second, through showing how their local leaders attempted to pursue local or personal interests by taking Sino-Japanese relations as hostage, it uses four local governments in Japan that have peculiar interaction with China as case studies.

In the last years of the Gaddafi regime, however, a large-scale temporary migrant community quickly formed. Then, as unrest in Libya increased, the community was withdrawn abruptly in early 2011 in China’s first officially organized mass evacuation. This short-lived community does not display the characteristics associated with Chinese migration to Africa as a whole, suggesting the necessity of local ethnographic case studies across the continent to form a more accurate and complete picture. Migration was spurred by labour contracted by state-owned enterprises (SOEs) from all over China, and did not feature private traders except for those who provided services for the labourers. It is probable that any recurrence of Chinese migration into Libya will again be SOE-driven, although favourable attitudes and policies on the part of the post-Gaddafi administration could possibly engender a more autonomous minority.

The Chinese and Indian governments have attempted to resolve the border dispute through diplomatic negotiations which have generated several meaningful documents. But the basic position of both the countries on the border dispute remains unchanged. Both sides have agreed to press ahead with the frame-work negotiations in accordance with the agreed political parameters and guiding principles so as to seek a fair and reasonable solution acceptable to them. Prior to that, both sides have agreed to work together to maintain peace and tranquillity in the border areas. While we are cautiously optimistic about the steady improvement of the bilateral relations between the two rising Asian giants, we are increasingly concerned about the consequences of their geopolitical rhetoric and strategic suspicion originating primarily from the unresolved border dispute. Their political leaders should understand and respect each other’s core national interests and major concerns, properly handle their differences, and seek common development and a win-win situation. A good China–India relationship makes both winners while a confrontational one makes both losers.

The article contends that the chief goal for those teaching about this aspect of Chinese politics should be to correct students' misperceptions about China and assist them in developing more empirically nuanced descriptions and theoretically grounded analyses of the way Beijing is approaching the rest of the world. It further argues that most students are able to accomplish this task.

Looking Eastward: Network Analysis of Czech Deputies and Their Foreign Policy Groups.,"Mochtak, Michal; Diviak, Tomas",Problems of Post-Communism,Nov/Dec2019,Taylor & Francis Ltd,INTERNATIONAL relations; LEGISLATORS; PUBLIC officers; CIVIL service positions; CORE & periphery (Economic theory); CZECH Republic,,"This article analyzes a structure of relations among the members of the Chamber of Deputies, the lower house of the Parliament of the Czech Republic, as reported through their memberships in bilateral and multilateral groups of friendship which establish professional contacts between the Chamber of Deputies and foreign parliaments. We approach the structure as a social network of members of parliament and interpret the memberships as proxy indicators of their interests/preferences in foreign affairs. This research shows that interparliamentary groups construct a self-sustained independent structure for parliamentary diplomacy which may significantly differ from the official positions of the government. We find that the studied network has a centralized core–periphery structure, in which deputies who are less prominent and those interested in authoritarian regimes occupy more central positions. This research connects the findings with the current debates on Central European tendencies to look for allies in large authoritarian regimes (Russia and China), for which we argue the interparliamentary groups might play the role of an important communication channel.

Looking Toward the Future in the Taiwan Strait: Generational Politics in Taiwan.,"Rigger, Shelley",SAIS Review of International Affairs,Summer/Fall2011,Johns Hopkins University Press,INTERNATIONAL relations; TAIWAN; CHINA; TAIWAN -- Politics & government -- 2000-; YOUTH,,"The article examines the generational politics in Taiwan. It explores the stand of the Taiwanese young generation on political issues and its role on the future of the country, particularly on its relationship with the People's Republic of China. The practical and theoretical significance of Taiwan's experience of generational politics are discussed. Generations formed by rapid changes in the internal policies and external relations of Taiwan are also discussed."
Ma Ying-jeou's Presidential Discourse.,"Sullivan, Jonathan; Sapir, Eliyahu V.",Journal of Current Chinese Affairs,2012,Sage Publications Inc.,"INTERNATIONAL relations; CONTENT analysis; TAIWAN; TAIWAN -- Politics & government -- 2000-; MA, Yingjiu, 1950-; SHUI-Bian, Chen",automated text analysis; cross-Strait relations; Ma Ying-jeou; presidential discourse; ROC president; Taiwan,"Despite the substantial advances made in cross-Strait relations during Ma Ying-jeou's (Ma Yingjiu) first term, the ROC president's rhetoric varied considerably as he grappled with the difficult reality of implementing campaign and inauguration pledges to establish better relations with China while striving to maintain national respect and sovereignty. In this article, we put forward a framework for measuring, analysing and explaining this variation in President Ma's first-term discourse. Analysing a very large number of Ma's speeches, addresses, etc., we provide empirical assessments of how the content of Ma's public pronouncements has developed over time, how his rhetoric varies according to the strategic context and timing of a speech, and how his discourse compares to that of his predecessor, Chen Shui-bian (Chen Shuibian). In addressing these questions, the article contributes a quantitative perspective to existing work on political discourse in Taiwan and to the growing methodological and applied literature on how to systematically analyse Chinese political text.

Ma Ying-jeou's re-election: implications for Taiwan and East Asia.,"Tsang, Steve",Pacific Review,12-Jul,Taylor & Francis Ltd,"POLITICAL succession; ELECTIONS; POLITICAL integration; INTERNATIONAL relations; BEIJING (China); DEMOCRATIC Progressive Party (Taiwan); TAIWAN -- Politics & government -- 2000-; TAIWAN; TAIWAN-United States relations; MA, Yingjiu, 1950-",cross-Strait relations; Ma Ying-jeou; mainland China; succession politics; Taiwan elections; US-PRC relations,"Ma Ying-jeou's re-election means that there will not be a leadership change in Taiwan, but it still has significant implications. It forces the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) to work out a succession for itself and confront the political reality that it must now persuade voters in Taiwan that it can manage relations with mainland China effectively in order to win the presidency again. It also requires Ma to define clearly the limits of his mainland policy in order to minimize Beijing's expectations of his second term, as no president of Taiwan can agree to move towards political integration without a popular mandate. On its part, Beijing has taken on board the significance of Taiwan's electoral cycle for managing cross-Strait ties and will put pressure on Ma to move forward over political integration and thus reduce the scope for a future DPP administration to reverse course. This notwithstanding, Beijing's Taiwan policy will ultimately be determined more by the result of the leadership succession in mainland China itself in the autumn of 2012. For USA and East Asia, Ma's re-election is a positive development as it minimizes the risk of a confrontation or a crisis across the Taiwan Strait. But it will not remove the main problems they have with China that are Taiwan related. For USA, arms sales to Taiwan will still be needed and will remain a source of tension with Beijing. For Southeast Asia, stability across the Taiwan Strait implies that Beijing can devote more attention and resources to the South China Sea territorial disputes and that it is likely to behave in a more assertive way.

"Making Sense of Malaysia’s China Policy: Asymmetry, Proximity, and Elite's Domestic Authority.","Kuik, Cheng-Chwee",Chinese Journal of International Politics,13-Dec,Oxford University Press / USA,LEGITIMATION (Sociology); INTERNATIONAL relations; MALAYSIA; BARISAN Nasional (Political party : Malaysia); CHINA -- Foreign relations; MALAYSIA -- Politics & government,,"Using Malaysia’s China policy as a case study of a smaller state’s response to a rising power, this article challenges the mainstream neorealist notion that the growing capability and geographical proximity of a rising power tend to induce fear among its weaker neighbours. By tracing the transformation of Malaysia’s China policy, the article’s findings indicate that power asymmetry and geographical proximity have no inherent logic of their own; rather, whether and to what extent the two variables will prompt smaller states to become fearful and/or attracted to a rising power is often a function of intervening factors at the domestic level, i.e. the imperative of ruling elite’s domestic legitimation. In the case of Malaysia’s China policy, it is the ruling Barisan Nasional elite’s desire to capitalize on the big power’s rise—for the ultimate goal of enhancing and justifying its political authority at home—that has driven the smaller state to adopt a hedging approach characterized by an inclination to prioritize immediate economic and diplomatic benefits over potential security concerns, while simultaneously attempting to keep its strategic options open for as long as the systemic conditions allow.

"Malaysia: perception of contemporary China and its economic, political and societal determinants.","Yeoh, Emile Kok-Kheng",Pacific Review,19-May,Taylor & Francis Ltd,ECONOMIC determinism; INTERNATIONAL relations; BALANCE of power; MALAYSIA; CHINA,China's rise; generation; Malaysian Chinese community; perception; politics,"This article looks at the Malaysian perception of the contemporary rise of China by focusing more on the country's societal response rather than from a broad overall perspective of international strategic relations and diplomacy. The Malaysian society is seen as a complex multi-entity construct, constituted by often sharply differentiated fragments and sub-fragments which could exhibit vastly different responses to the implications of the rise of China. Within such a construct, perception of the rise of China and the appropriate Malaysian response are intricately entwined with domestic power politics, generational transition and governmental control over public discourse. Hence, the Malaysian perception of the contemporary rise of China is as complex as the Malaysian society itself, and what is revealed in official government policies and public discourses in the dominant mass media would fail to reflect the real depth of the issue if the intrinsic complexity of the Malaysian society is not taken into due consideration.
