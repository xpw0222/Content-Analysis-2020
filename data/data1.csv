"(Mis)perceptions of Domestic Politics in the U.S.-China Rapprochement, 1969–1978.","Millwood, Pete",Diplomatic History,Oxford University Press / USA,"HISTORY; DIPLOMATIC history; DIPLOMACY; CHINA-United States relations; 20TH century; TWENTIETH century; WATERGATE Affair, 1972-1974; CHINA -- Politics & government -- 20th century; UNITED States -- Politics & government -- 20th century; NIXON, Richard M. (Richard Milhous), 1913-1994; MAO, Zedong, 1893-1976; KISSINGER, Henry, 1923-; BRZEZINSKI, Zbigniew, 1928-2017",,"The article discusses the influence of U.S. and Chinese domestic politics on U.S.-China diplomatic relations from 1969 to 1978. Topics explored include the political significance of the 1972 meeting between then U.S. President Richard Nixon and Chinese Communist Party Chairman Mao Zedong in China, the contributions of U.S. foreign policymakers Henry Kissinger and Zbigniew Brzezinski to Chinese domestic politics, the response of the Chinese government to the Watergate political scandal involving Nixon, and the offering of satellite intelligence assistance to China by Kissinger to demonstrate his commitment to the U.S.-China rapprochement process."
30 Years After Tiananmen: Dissent Is Not Dead.,"Economy, Elizabeth",Journal of Democracy,Johns Hopkins University Press,HUMAN rights; INTERNATIONAL relations; CHINESE Communist Party,,"In developments that form a stark contrast to the hopes that accompanied the Tiananmen Square demonstrations of thirty years ago, Xi Jinping's Chinese Communist Party regime has devised new ways to consolidate power and crackdown on dissent. Yet despite an ever-expanding surveillance apparatus and a burgeoning social-credit system, the political values and spirit of collective action embodied in the 1989 democracy movement have endured and even thrived. Indeed, while the Xi government may appear all-powerful, political fissures are widening, and there are many pockets of discontent. China may not appear to be moving on the right track-but we have not yet reached the end of Chinese history."
30 Years After Tiananmen: Hong Kong Remembers.,"Tai, Benny",Journal of Democracy,Johns Hopkins University Press,DEMONSTRATIONS (Collective behavior); CHINESE Communist Party; GOING public (Securities),,"The three landmark events in Hong Kong's ongoing struggle for democracy over the past thirty years were directly or indirectly connected with the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989. Inspired by the sacrifices of the students and citizens in Beijing, Hong Kong people continue to strive to establish a democratic system to defend Hong Kong's way of life against interference by the Chinese Communist Party. The souls of Tiananmen Square have not left Hong Kong, and Hong Kong's persistent struggle for democracy may have preserved the seeds ofchange in China."
30 Years After Tiananmen: Memory in the Era of Xi Jinping.,"Tiffert, Glenn",Journal of Democracy,Johns Hopkins University Press,"INTERNATIONAL relations; CHINESE Communist Party; XI, Jinping, 1953-",,"The Chinese Communist Party allows no public commemoration of the protest movement that it violently crushed in the vicinity of Tiananmen Square in 1989, but its private reckoning with that tragedy has never mattered more. President Xi Jinping has quietly taken Tiananmen as a guiding light, reading it as a cautionary tale of regime decay and a playbook for revival. This view has inspired his campaigns to tackle corruption, restore ideological discipline, and reclaim control over history. And the most lasting contribution of all to Xi's tenure may be the selective rehabilitation of traditional Chinese culture as a source of political legitimacy."
30 Years After Tiananmen: The Meaning of June 4th.,"Dan, Wang",Journal of Democracy,Johns Hopkins University Press,INTERNATIONAL relations; POLITICAL participation; CHINESE Communist Party,,"The 1989 democracy movement and its suppression marked a watershed in China's contemporary history. The movement has influenced China's subsequent development in at least three major ways. First, it was an enlightenment movement that spread the concept of democracy far and wide. Second, it played a vital role in grooming talent for the development of China's civil society and the next wave of prodemocracy activism. Third, it laid a foundation for democratization in China's political culture and popular mindsets. At the same time, the movement's violent suppression left a legacy of fear and has led to the elevation of economic over social goals; a general attitude of defeatism; and a profound deterioration in social morality and ethics"
30 Years After Tiananmen: The Young and the Restless.,"Gilley, Bruce",Journal of Democracy,Johns Hopkins University Press,DEMOCRATIZATION; POLITICAL participation; CHINESE Communist Party,,"China's ruling Communist Party is admired by specialists for its seeming ability to deliver all kinds of things without democracy-elite stability, good governance, legitimacy, capitalist growth, and a middle class. But in all these areas, durable achievements have proven elusive. A president for life, worsening governance, and ticking time bombs of slow growth and fiscal deficits threaten stability. The balance of forces still favors the status quo, but the regime worries about a tilt in the odds. Outside of top cities, meanwhile, China's growing ranks of disgruntled single males are slipping from the control of the Party's social-monitoring system."
"A Brave New World, or the Same Old Story with New Characters?","Ghosh, Jayati",Development & Change,Wiley-Blackwell,CAPITALISM; IMPERIALISM; ECONOMIC policy; BILATERAL treaties; INTERNATIONAL economic relations; CHINA; 2000-,,"Capitalism has always been a global system, but not in fixed ways. Different national powers have emerged and become dominant over the centuries, but the fundamental processes underlying the uneven development of global capitalism have not altered; they continue to be driven by imperialism — the struggle of large capital over economic territory of various kinds. Since the late 1960s, only the East Asian region has shown notable increases in its share of global GDP, and for the last two decades this has been dominated by the rise of China. This is directly related to the ability of the Chinese state to control the economy and to implement heterodox policies with very high investment rates. However, the Chinese case is exceptional: few other developing countries have followed a trajectory anything like that of China. Meanwhile, internal inequalities have increased across the world, as the bargaining power of capital vis‐à‐vis labour has increased dramatically in every country. This reflects the changed form of 21st century imperialism, which relies increasingly on the international legal and regulatory architecture as fortified by various multilateral, plurilateral and bilateral agreements that establish the hegemony of global capital in different ways."
A Cautionary report: resilience of the U.S.–ROK Alliance During the Pro–North Korea Engagement Era of Progressive rule in South Korea.,"Shin, David",North Korean Review,"McFarland & Company, Inc.",POLITICAL parties; SOUTH Korea; BETROTHAL; CHRONOLOGY; SUNSHINE,China factor; impeachment; North Korea policy; North Korean threat; progressive rule; Sunshine Policy; U.S.–ROK alliance; U.S.–ROK–Japan relations; wartime OPCON,"Purpose—Many believe progressive rule in South Korea, symbolized by its pro-engagement policy with Pyongyang, means weakening of the U.S.–ROK alliance. This study aims to demonstrate the resilience of the alliance even during progressive rule. Design/Methodology/Approach—The study uses a combination of observation and informal interviews as a U.S. military attaché and staff officer to identify key factors that weakened the U.S.–ROK alliance during the progressive Sunshine Policy era of Kim Dae-jung/roo Moo-hyun and examines the current state of the alliance under Moon Jae-in’s progressive rule. Findings—overall, despite the many challenges of maintaining the U.S.–ROK alliance during periods of progressive rule in South Korea, Seoul and Washington have effectively managed to accommodate each other’s interests to maintain a strong alliance. Practical Implications—observers should not expect the weakening of the U.S.–ROK alliance simply because of progressive rule in South Korea. Seoul and Washington can and have previously worked together during progressive rule to maintain and strengthen the alliance. Originality/Value—This is one of the few studies that warns against simplistic interpretations of U.S.–ROK relations during progressive rule in South Korea and emphasizes that the resilience of the U.S.–ROK alliance goes beyond party politics in Seoul (and Washington). More importantly, Americans should not assume that the election of a progressive ruler in South Korea is necessarily a prelude to anti–U.S. politics in Seoul."

"A Comparative View of Advocacy Coalitions: Exploring Shale Development Politics in the United States, Argentina, and China.","Heikkila, Tanya; Berardo, Ramiro; Weible, Christopher M.; Yi, Hongtao",Journal of Comparative Policy Analysis,Taylor & Francis Ltd,POLITICAL systems; POLITICAL opportunity theory; ADVOCACY coalition framework,advocacy coalitions; comparative policy process; environmental policy; fracking; shale oil and gas,"Political mobilization of policy actors into advocacy coalitions is a defining feature of policy subsystems. Nonetheless, knowledge about the particularities of advocacy coalitions across different political systems remains limited. This paper offers insights for comparative analysis of advocacy coalitions by exploring the issue of shale development in the United States, Argentina, and China using media content analysis. Methodologically, it advances the study of coalitions by introducing a standardized approach for measuring coalition attributes across countries. Empirically, it explores how coalitions vary in their composition across countries with different political opportunity structures."
A DEAL IS STRUCK IN BUENOS AIRES.,"GLASER, BONNIE S.; FLAHERTY, KELLY",Comparative Connections: A Triannual E-Journal on East Asian Bilateral Relations,Center for Strategic & International Studies,TARIFF; COMMERCIAL treaties; SANCTIONS (International law),,"On the sidelines of the G20 summit, Donald Trump and Xi Jinping put tariff hikes on hold and agreed to resume trade negotiations. Prior to the agreement, the US-China spat spilled over into the multilateral arena causing the first-ever failure to reach a joint communique at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) meeting in Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea. The imposition of sanctions by the US on the People's Liberation Army's Equipment Development Department and its director resulted in a temporary setback in military ties. The US took actions against Chinese individuals and hacking rings for allegedly stealing US technology to gain commercial advantage. The second US-China Diplomatic and Security Dialogue was held in Washington DC. Trump and Xi talked by phone in November and December."
A Good Neighbor of Bad Governance? China's Energy and Mining Development in Southeast Asia.,"Liao, Jessica C.",Journal of Contemporary China,Taylor & Francis Ltd,DIPLOMACY; INTERNATIONAL relations; ENERGY development; BELT & Road Initiative; BUSINESS partnerships,,"The policies of Going Out and Good Neighbor have worked in tandem to direct Chinese diplomacy toward Southeast Asia over the past decades. This article asks how these policies have shaped Chinese energy and mining firms' business decisions in the region. Using a combination of quantitative and qualitative data, this article argues that while Going Out and Good Neighbor have contributed to the growth of China's energy and mining development projects in Southeast Asia, this outcome is not merely the result of a state-directed initiative. The growth is also driven by Chinese state-owned firms that take advantage of Beijing's policy agenda and the institutional shortcomings behind it to plow state-backed resources into business partnerships with weak rule-of-law governments in the region. These partnerships and the associated projects are often touted as an arm of Chinese diplomacy, emboldening these firms to make risky expansion. Moreover, market, diplomatic, social, and geographic factors inherent to Southeast Asia further catalyze Chinese firms' risky business practices while at the same time Beijing, prioritizing diplomatic relations over good governance, has been slow to police problems stemming from its firms' dubious partnerships. In the end, this situation has hurt China's image, contrary to Good Neighbor's intended objectives."
A guide for thinking about space deterrence and China.,"Lambakis, Steve",Comparative Strategy,Taylor & Francis Ltd,ENEMIES; BOMBINGS; CHINA; ARTIFICIAL satellites in telecommunication; GLOBAL Positioning System,,"China's economy and military forces are becoming more reliant on space systems.[31] China reportedly has about 250 satellites on orbit, with plans to develop more advanced space systems.[32] China continues to improve the capabilities of its military and intelligence satellites. A paper published by the U.S.-China Economic and Security Commission reports that China also may have tested a high altitude ASAT aimed at attacking GPS satellites.[64] In May 2013 China launched an object into space on a ballistic trajectory that took it near GEO where the United States operates critical early warning, signals intelligence, and communications satellites. Beijing is successfully leveraging its investment ties with more than 60 countries to enforce its foreign policy objectives, and shape foreign interests to align with China's interests, deter confrontation and criticism of China, and in essence bully other countries through debt diplomacy.[180] Any U.S. military success in the Indo-Pacific region, particularly against an ally of China, would be a significant loss of face and a huge blow to not only China's international image, but also to its self-image. Even though China would not want to see major damage to trading relationships, China sees the United States as a competitor to its national objectives and has structured its military forces and deterrence concepts accordingly.[201] We also can assume that Beijing knows that the United States is committed to the security and economic well-being of its allies in the Asia-Pacific region."
A literary approach to Afro-Sino relations: Ufrieda Ho's Paper Sons and Daughters: Growing Up Chinese in South Africa and Ken N. Kamoche's Black Ghosts.,"Vasser, Uchenna P.",Third World Quarterly,Taylor & Francis Ltd,"AFRICA-China relations; IDENTITY (Psychology) in literature; IMMIGRANTS in literature; OVERSEAS Chinese; PAPER Sons & Daughters: Growing up Chinese in South Africa: A Memoir (Book); BLACK Ghosts (Book); KAMOCHE, Ken; HO, Ufrieda",Africa; China; identity-formation; immigrant; inclusion; Literature; migration,"The Afro-Sino engagement supports the study of international relations beyond the framework of a West-centric narrative. Ken Kamoche's fictionalisation of African immigrants in China, and Ufrieda Ho's narration of the vicissitudes of Chinese communities in South Africa, contemplate the consequence of the Africa–Asia engagement on the human condition. While the attendant political apparatuses in the African continent and China laud the mutual benefits of engagement, Kamoche and Ho, by focusing on issues of transmigration, displacement and belonging, identity-formation, and so forth expose the acute Sinocentrism and Afrocentrism that impede the seamless establishment of migrant communities in both geopolitical spaces. The principal objectives of this essay involve a close reading of Kamoche and Ho's novels to focus on the non-state participants of the Afro-Sino relations, and to discuss the emerging transnational, migrant literature that is at once African and Chinese. Ultimately, this essay suggests the formulation of a literary subgenre to embrace the Afro-Sino literary imagination."

A Middle Power's Roles in Shaping East Asian Security Order: Analysis of Japan's Engagement from a Normative Perspective.,"Hatakeyama, Kyoko",Australian Journal of Politics & History,Wiley-Blackwell,REGIONALISM (International organization); NATIONAL security; JAPAN -- Foreign relations; EAST Asia -- Foreign relations; CHINA -- Foreign relations; CHINA-United States relations,,"East Asia is currently in a transitional period. Recognizing the challenges presented by China's rise to the current regional order, existing literature analyses the security situation in Asia by focusing on the material aspects of power distribution between the US and China. Few works substantively discuss the roles played by middle powers such as Japan in shaping the regional order and how they can deal with the challenges of great power competition and threats to the global rules‐based order. By employing Japan's involvement in the South China Sea issues as a case study, this article examines how a middle power attempts to shape or underpin the regional security order and if such attempts are effective. The investigation of Japan's engagement illustrates that a middle power's practical support can indirectly and gradually contribute to sustaining and defending the regional ""rules‐based order""."
A NEO-GRAMSCIAN ANALYSIS OF THE INCOMPLETE DOHA DEVELOPMENT TRADE ROUND.,"Balkan Şahin, Üyesi Sevgi",Ankara Universitesi SBF Dergisi / Ankara University SBF Journal,Ankara University SBF Journal,,Counter-hegemony; Doha trade round; Emerging powers; Hegemony; NGOs; Doha ticaret görüşmeleri; Hegemonya; Karşı-hegemonya; Sivil toplum kuruluşları; Yükselen güçler,"This paper analyzes the lack of progress and the breakdown of the Doha Round talks in world trade since 2001 from a neo-Gramscian perspective. The failure to conclude multilateral trade negotiations reflect an emerging new architecture of power politics in the world political-economic order. Major economic powers, including the United States (US), the European Union (EU), Japan and Canada as well as leading transnational companies used to have a significant impact on guiding the agenda of the multilateral trade negotiations as well as defining the outcomes. However, in the context of the WTO, emerging powers such as India, Brazil, and China and several non-governmental organizations critical of neoliberal globalization began to confront the former groups' dominance. Developing and developed countries have contending views on the agenda issues, marked by confrontation on the former's insistence for the liberalization of agricultural markets by industrialized states and the latter's pressure for the liberalization of non-agricultural markets. Both sides employ certain strategies and discourses to coerce or to persuade the opposing parties. Hence, the paper argues that the multilateral trade negotiations emerge as zones of exercising hegemony rather than being an area to produce common norms, values and policies for the well-being of all members in the world trade regime."
A Nested Case–Control Study on Plasma Vitamin E and Risk of Cancer: Evidence of Effect Modification by Selenium.,"Wang, Jiancheng; Guo, Huiyuan; Lin, Tengfei; Song, Yun; Zhang, Hao; Wang, Binyan; Zhang, Yan; Li, Jianping; Huo, Yong; Wang, Xiaobin; Qin, Xianhui; Xu, Xiping",Journal of the Academy of Nutrition & Dietetics,Elsevier B.V.,LOGISTIC regression analysis; CHINA; TUMORS -- Risk factors; CONFIDENCE intervals; ESOPHAGEAL tumors; HYPERTENSION; LIQUID chromatography; MASS spectrometry; SELENIUM; TIME; VITAMIN E; GASTROINTESTINAL tumors; DISEASE incidence; CASE-control method; ODDS ratio,Antioxidant; Cancer incidence; Hypertension; Selenium; Vitamin E,"Abstract Background Evidence from epidemiologic studies has been inconsistent regarding the role of vitamin E in cancer incidence risk. Objective The aim of this study was to evaluate the prospective association between baseline plasma vitamin E levels and subsequent cancer risk in Chinese adults with hypertension, and to identify effect modifiers. Design A nested, case–control study was conducted from 20,702 hypertensive participants in the China Stroke Primary Prevention Trial, a randomized, double-blind, controlled trial, conducted from May 2008 to August 2013. Participants The current study included 229 new cancer cases and 229 controls matched for age (±1 year), sex, treatment group, and study site. Main outcome measures Plasma vitamin E was measured by liquid chromatography with tandem quadrupole mass spectrometers and plasma selenium was measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry using Thermo Fisher iCAP Q ICP-MS. Statistical analyses Odds ratios (OR) of cancer in relation to plasma concentrations of vitamin E were calculated using conditional logistic regression models. Results Median follow-up duration was 4.5 years. Overall, vitamin E was not associated with subsequent risk of total cancer (per 1-mg/L [2.3 μmol/L] increase: OR 1.01, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.09) and non-gastrointestinal cancer (OR 1.10, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.24). However, there was a significant, inverse association between vitamin E and gastrointestinal cancer (OR 0.86, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.99), particularly esophageal cancer (OR 0.67, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.95). Moreover, high vitamin E decreased the risk of total cancer (OR 0.91, 95% CI 0.84 to 0.99) and gastrointestinal cancer (OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.95) among patients with high selenium levels (median≥83.7 μg/L [1.1 μmol/L]), and increased the risk of total cancer (OR 1.13, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.26) and non-gastrointestinal cancer (OR 1.25, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.50) among those with low selenium levels (<83.7 μg/L [1.1 μmol/L]). Conclusions This study suggests that higher levels of plasma vitamin E are associated with reduced risk of gastrointestinal cancer. High vitamin E decreased the risk of total cancer among patients with high selenium levels, but increased the risk of total cancer among those with low selenium levels."
A New Alliance against the US? Sino-Russian Relations in Response to Trump's Redefined Foreign Policy Priorities.,"Ciborek, Przemysław",International Studies: Interdisciplinary Political & Cultural Journal,Sciendo,"INTERNATIONAL relations; RUSSIA; CHINA; CHINA-Russia relations; TRUMP, Donald, 1946-",Barack Obama; bilateral relations; China; Donald Trump; economic protectionism; economic sanctions; Pivot to Asia; Russia; USA; Vladimir Putin; Xi Jinping,"The current state of bilateral relations between the Russian Federation and the People's Republic of China is described by many international relations experts as the best in history. After taking the president office by Donald Trump, the bilateral relations between America and abovementioned powers are cooling down. Current foreign policy of the People's Republic of China and the Russian Federation focuses on holding a common position in the international political arena, which is in fact an attempt to counter-weight political influence of the US administration and their allies. The dimension of the strategic partnership between China and Russia is also determining the mutual economic dependence, which is now crucial for both powers to build a strong position on the international forum. In addition, Russia is one of the crucial partners for the Chinese-led Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) – by many recognized as the Chinese attempt to break the American economic domination. The collisional course of the American foreign policy towards Russia and China forces the latter to look for Central and Eastern European allies as well as to gain influence in the region of Central Asia which is leading to a constant increase in tensions between China and Russia."
A NEW CHAPTER?,"SNYDER, SCOTT; BYUN, SEE-WON",Comparative Connections: A Triannual E-Journal on East Asian Bilateral Relations,Center for Strategic & International Studies,"CULTURAL relations; RURAL development; HUMAN rights; PYONGYANG (Korea); NORTH Korea; KOREANS; MOON; XI, Jinping, 1953-",,"Beijing and Pyongyang celebrate 70 years of diplomatic relations this year. Xi Jinping traveled to Pyongyang in June for a fifth summit with Kim Jong Un, the first visit to North Korea by China's top leader in 14 years. The meeting aimed to advance the bilateral friendship to a new phase of comprehensive development and drive regional coordination on the Korean Peninsula. In contrast, Xi's 40-minute meeting with South Korean President Moon Jae-in on the sidelines of the G20 Summit in Osaka seemed to marginalize Moon, subordinate the relationship with South Korea, and place Xi as an intermediary between North Korea and the rest of world. Pyongyang's missile tests, however, showed the limited effects of such diplomacy, even after surprise exchanges between US, North Korean, and South Korean leaders in Panmunjom on June 30. The current expansion of China-DPRK political, military, economic, and cultural exchanges also presents challenges to sanctions implementation and human rights promotion."
A New Model of Multilateral Development Bank: a Comparative Study of Road Projects by the AIIB and ADB.,"Zhao, Jianzhi; Gou, Yannan; Li, Wanying",Journal of Chinese Political Science,Springer Nature,DEVELOPMENT banks; INTERNATIONAL economic assistance; INFRASTRUCTURE (Economics); ECONOMIC development; ASIAN Infrastructure Investment Bank; ASIAN Development Bank; ROAD design & construction,ADB; AIIB; Case study; Governance structure; Project analysis,"As one of the hallmarks of China's increasing participation in global economic governance, the establishment of the Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) has been widely studied by scholars and policy circles worldwide. However, most of the existing studies use narrative methods and lack microscopic or macroscopic evidence. By selecting two highly comparable cases, road projects from the AIIB and the traditional multilateral development bank, the Asian Development Bank (ADB), we analyze the management structure, procurement, economy, risk, supervision and safeguard policy framework for both cases. We find that the AIIB mostly aligns with international practices in critical principles but has streamlined project procurement, risk and supervision, which reflects its claim of being ""lean"" and ""clean"". We argue that compared with the ADB, the AIIB is probably more efficient and economically sustainable, which is an improvement on the traditional multilateral development banks (MDBs). However, whether the streamlined procedures lead to higher risks will be tested in time as the AIIB conducts more independent projects in the future."
A new welfare regime in the making?

This article uses the wider socio-economic and socio-political contexts to critically examine whether there is a new welfare regime on the rise in China, with a particular reference to whether the increase in social expenditure has really marked a new welfare philosophy or prompted the transformation of China into a protective welfare regime. By analysing prefecture-level data for government expenditures in education, health, social security and assistance programmes between 2003 and 2012, we show a continuation of the Chinese welfare regime in 'paternalistic welfare pragmatism' for two reasons. First, government social expenditures are set on the basis of the prefecture-level government's fiscal capacity. Second, variations of welfare programmes are associated with the dichotomy between the urban formal and informal sectors."
A Path to Critical Citizenship? Evidence from a Panel Study among Chinese Students Studying in Taiwan.,Chia-chou Wang,Taiwan Journal of Democracy,Taiwan Foundation for Democracy,CITIZEN attitudes; PANEL analysis; POLITICAL attitudes; TAIWAN; CHINESE-speaking students; CHINA studies; NEW Year,Casual contact; institutional trust; lifelong openness model; political learning; true acquaintances,"This study explores whether political socialization in Taiwan affects the political attitudes of Chinese students who study in Taiwan, transforming them into critical citizens. A panel study was conducted to examine the level of change in institutional trust in the Communist Party of China, the central government, and the military among Chinese students studying in Taiwan, and to explain change based on political socialization theory and social contact theory. This study found that, after living and studying in Taiwan for four months, Chinese students gradually became critical citizens. Their degree of trust in the institutions of China decreased an average of 0.37 (7.64 percent). Factors that led to a decrease in institutional trust among the Chinese students were visiting a local government agency in Taiwan, visiting the National Palace Museum, frequently interacting with Taiwanese friends, attending the flag-raising ceremony on New Year's Day, having a more negative evaluation of the CPC's performance, and having a decreased preference for the Chinese government. According to the study's findings, if we wish to change the level of trust toward Chinese institutions among Chinese students studying in Taiwan, the following four approaches may be effective: publicize government performance; encourage cross-Strait friendships; encourage discussions among peers; and avoid cross-Strait confrontations."
A Question of Costliness: Time Horizons and Interstate Signaling.,"Haynes, Kyle",Journal of Conflict Resolution,Sage Publications Inc.,"INTERNATIONAL relations -- Psychological aspects; POWER (Social sciences); HISTORY; GAME theory; GREAT powers (International relations); SIGNALLING (Psychology); CHINA-United States relations; INTENTION; GOAL (Psychology); XI, Jinping, 1953-",credibility; game theory; power shift; reassurance; signaling,"This article examines how interstate signaling processes operate under multiple dimensions of uncertainty. The existing signaling literature largely assumes that states communicate and infer one another's intentions in a simplified context where they are only uncertain about one component of the other's preferences. Relaxing this unrealistic assumption, I develop a model of interstate reassurance in which the receiver is uncertain of both the compatibility of the sender's goals and its time horizons. If a receiving state is unsure of the sending state's time horizons, it is more difficult to determine the costliness of a given signal, and thus how credible it is as an indicator of the sender's preferences. I show that under certain conditions, shorter time horizons lead to more credible signaling as states become less willing to incur the short-term costs of misrepresentation. Under other conditions, however, shortened time horizons can incentivize hedging behavior, thus undermining a benign state's ability to credibly signal its intentions. Finally, the model reveals that multidimensional uncertainty can actually facilitate cooperation across a wider range of conditions than one-dimensional uncertainty. I present two brief case illustrations and discuss the model's implications for contemporary US–China relations."

A Role for India in the Korean Peace Process: Contemplating Non‐Realist Approaches to Broaden Relations with the Korean Peninsula.,"Ouellette, Dean J.",Pacific Focus,Wiley-Blackwell,PEACEBUILDING; PEACE; INTERNATIONAL economic relations; INTERNATIONAL relations; INDIA; EAST Asians; DIGITAL footprint; PENINSULAS,engagement; foreign policy; India‐Korea relations; inter‐Korean relations; leadership; peacebuilding; people‐to‐people relations,"As part of its past ""Look East"" and now ""Act East"" policies, India seeks to increase the radius of its influence beyond South Asia by broadening relations with East Asian actors, including South Korea. New Delhi and Seoul continue to promote economic cooperation and explore ways to deepen their strategic partnership. However, for relations to grow substantively and enduringly, both will have to show greater concern, creativity, and caution—especially bearing in mind their mutual neighbor, China. This article explores how, through harnessing its unique longstanding relations with both Koreas and investing in non‐realist approaches resonant of people‐centered engagement, India as a middle power with major power aspirations can lay its footprint softly in Northeast Asia by playing a more pro‐active role to bolster and sustain inter‐Korean rapprochement and peacebuilding efforts."
A sleeping giant awakes? The rise of the Institutional Grammar Tool (IGT) in policy research.,"Dunlop, Claire A.; Kamkhaji, Jonathan C.; Radaelli, Claudio M.",Journal of Chinese Governance,Taylor & Francis Ltd,INTERNATIONAL relations; GOVERNMENT policy; META-analysis; INSTITUTIONAL investors; CORPORATE governance,governance; Institutional Analysis and Development (IAD); Institutional Grammar Tool (IGT); Policy design; theories of the policy process,"The Institutional Grammar Tool (IGT) is an important and relatively recent innovation in policy theory and analysis. It is conceptualized to empirically operationalize the insights of the Institutional Analysis and Development (IAD) framework. In the last decade, political scientists have offered a number of applications of the IGT, mainly focused on disclosing and scrutinizing in-depth the textual configurations of policy documents. These efforts, involving micro-level analyses of syntax as well as more general classifications of institutional statements according to rule types, have underpinned empirical projects mainly in the area of environmental and common-pool resources. Applications of IGT are still in their infancy, yet the growing momentum is sufficient for us to review what has been learned so far. We take stock of this recent, fast-growing literature, analyzing a corpus of 26 empirical articles employing IGTs published between 2008 and 2017. We examine them in terms of their empirical domain, hypotheses, and methods of selection and analysis of institutional statements. We find that the existing empirical applications do not add much to explanation, unless they are supported by research questions and hypotheses grounded in theory. We offer three conclusions. First, to exploit the IGT researchers need to go beyond the descriptive, computational approach that has dominated the field until now. Second, IGT studies grounded in explicit hypotheses have more explanatory leverage, and therefore, should be encouraged when adopting the tool outside the Western world. Third, by focusing on rules, researchers can capture findings that are more explanatory and less microscopic."
A spatial valence model of political participation in China.,"Wu, Jason Y.",Journal of Theoretical Politics,"Sage Publications, Ltd.",POLITICAL participation; IDEOLOGY; POLITICAL competition; STOCHASTIC models; CHINESE,China; ideology; political participation; valence,"In spatial models of political competition in democracies, citizens vote for the party or candidate that is the closest to their own ideological position, while in valence models, voters decide on the basis of non-policy factors, such as competence. What remains unclear, however, is whether citizens in authoritarian regimes use spatial or valence considerations to guide their decisions to participate in politics. This study uses data from the 2015 Chinese Urban Governance Survey to measure the ideology of Chinese citizens, and estimates an empirical stochastic model to explore how Chinese citizens use ideological distance and valence to determine how they want to participate in politics. The results show that valence issues, such as perceived government competence, play a larger role in political participation than ideology."

Although Colombia has been attracting inward FDI in quantities similar to other key regional states, its macroeconomic and sectoral features and investment attraction policies positively correlate with many of the factors known to attract Chinese outward FDI (OFDI), and both the Colombia and Chinese governments are committed to increasing Chinese OFDI (COFDI) flows to Colombia, COFDI volumes to the Andean nation have yet to live up to expectations. This puzzling case highlights the need for a better understanding of the political-economic factors that drive COFDI. My case study show that Colombia's political and economic traits have been hindering COFDI. Regarding the former, Colombia's local politics regarding extractive activities and bidding on infrastructure projects and its close relations with the United States function to create an adverse environment for increased COFDI. With respect to the latter, the international economic environment, especially regarding commodities' prices, has impaired Chinese investment in Colombia. Overall, Colombia's case underscores the delicate interplay of international, national, and subnational factors on COFDI flows."

"A Truly Ancient ""Great Divergence""––A New History of the Chinese State.","Goldstone, Jack A.",Chinese Sociological Review,Taylor & Francis Ltd,"INDUSTRIALIZATION; CONFUCIANISM; CHINESE history; CONFUCIAN-Legalist State, The (Book); DINGXIN Zhao",,"Zhao provides a new view of why China remained politically united, but unable to achieve industrialization. He traces the roots of both conditions back to the Warring States period, when Chinese leaders developed authoritarian-bureaucratic governance and combined it with Confucian moral ideas and statecraft as a legitimating ideology. This Confucian-legalist state structure proved resilient enough to hold China together despite changes of dynasty, foreign invasions, the incursion of Buddhism, and heterodox ideas. Zhao argues that this stable state structure also precluded industrialization, because it marginalized commercial thinking and allowed no space for autonomous merchant organizations or other corporate or privileged bodies. This is a valuable and impressive overview of Chinese history; but European and Chinese histories themselves need to be viewed as embedded in global history. In this context, Europeans' awareness of their technical backwardness compared to China, and differences in the evolution of classical thought in Europe vs. the evolution of Confucianism in China, are also necessary to explain why Europe was able to industrialize but China was not."

The Afro-Asian Writers' Bureau was founded as a counter-narrative to Eurocentric conceptions of World Literature and universal culture. The AAWB's vision was inspired by a Marxian understanding of worldliness. Relying on Chinese archival materials, this article shows how Chinese representatives to the AAWB, including Zhou Yang and Mao Dun, shifted from an explicitly Soviet, socialist-realist model for World Literature inspired by Maxim Gorky to a progressively independent, nationalist course in the wake of the Sino-Soviet split. The story of the AAWB is one of competing universal visions. The Chinese contributions to the AAWB are also reflected in China's current expanding cultural influence and soft power in the Global South."
A Zero-Sum Game? Repression and Protest in China.,"Li, Yao",Government & Opposition,Cambridge University Press,DEMONSTRATIONS (Collective behavior); POLITICAL persecution; CHINA -- Politics & government,authoritarian politics; China; contentious politics; protest event analysis; repression,"Most scholarship on contentious politics in authoritarian regimes focuses on severe repression and transgressive protest (e.g. revolt), suggesting a zero-sum game played by the state and challengers. However, a burgeoning literature suggests that less brutal forms of authoritarian states have emerged in recent decades and that protesters in these countries tend to limit their challenges, avoiding direct confrontation with the authorities. If so, can the notion of the zero-sum game truly capture the nuances and complexities of contentious politics in authoritarian regimes? Taking the case of China, this article offers a systematic analysis of the pattern of repression and protest in a strong authoritarian state. Drawing on an original data set of 1,418 protest events in China, this article shows that the Chinese state permits some (albeit limited) space for protest and that most protesters confine themselves to this space. These findings thus provide quantitative evidence that popular contention in China is featured by a non-zero-sum game. Overall, this study contributes to a more comprehensive and complex understanding of popular contention in authoritarian settings."
"Abolishing the One-Child Policy: Stages, Issues and the Political Process.","Scharping, Thomas",Journal of Contemporary China,Taylor & Francis Ltd,"FAMILY policy; FAMILY planning; BUREAUCRACY; POLITICAL leadership; PUBLIC support; ONE-child policy, China; CHINA; BIRTH control",,"Based on a documentary, statistical and discourse analysis, plus 30 years of interviewing in China, this article investigates the demo-political background of China's return to a two-child policy in 2015. It pinpoints the contested core issues that fueled a bitter polemic on the future course of Chinese birth policy and continue to fester in ongoing controversies. The article briefly reviews earlier challenges to China's controversial one-child policy since its inception in 1979/80, details the conflicts and mechanisms shaping the birth planning regime since 2000, and examines the role played by academic counseling, bureaucratic infighting, lobbying and civil society in the about-turn. Comparing birth planning to other policy arenas, it concludes with a discussion of societal and think-tank impact on Chinese political decision-making."

This study focuses on the detrimental effects of AS on employee turnover intention, which is one of the major concerns for firms in China. We examined the underlying psychological mechanism between AS and turnover intention, specifically by focusing on the mediational role of psychological capital (Luthans et al., 2007) based on the conservation of resources theory (COR, from Hobfoll, 2002). By explaining the process of how AS can deplete individuals' resources, which leads to protective behaviour and attitudes, we attempt to integrate COR theory into the existing AS literature. We also investigated the moderating role of broader organizational contexts represented by organizational justice perception in the relationship between AS and turnover intention, showing boundary conditions where the effects of AS can be amplified with regard to overall organizational justice perception. Based on survey data collected from young factory workers in northern China, this study finds that abusive supervision is positively correlated with turnover intention. Psychological capital, especially optimism, mediates this relationship. In addition, when workers perceived high levels of procedural and distributive organizational justice, this association between abusive supervision and turnover intention was even stronger. Furthermore, the perception of procedural organizational justice also moderated the mediation mechanism of optimism between abusive supervision and turnover intention. This paper enriches the extant studies by considering the relationship between abusive supervision and its negative consequences for manufacturing workplaces in a non-western country, a context that has been little studied. In addition, by showing how psychological capital and the perception of organizational justice affect the AS-turnover intention relationship, this paper provides a nuanced and deeper understanding of the psychological mechanism and organizational context of abusive supervision."
Academic Censorship in China: The Case of The China Quarterly.,"Wong, Mathew Y. H.; Kwong, Ying-ho",PS: Political Science & Politics,Cambridge University Press,"CENSORSHIP; CHINA; SCHOLARLY publishing; CHINA Quarterly, The (Periodical)",,"The recent censorship requests made by Chinese authorities to Western academic publishers have sent shockwaves throughout the academic world. This article examines the high-profile The China Quarterly incident as a case in point. Because the censorship is expected to be followed by similar demands to other publications, it is important for the academic community to explore the logic behind it. This research article provides a preliminary analysis of publications on the censorship list and compares them to uncensored articles on similar themes. This exercise allows us to draw important insights. Theoretically, this article makes an original contribution by going beyond the censorship within to outside China. Empirically, it offers a comprehensive analysis of what China wants to censor and the context for its actions."

We put forward a framework of analysis for capturing the processes of making accountability and legitimacy. We introduce the ideas of first- and second-order accountability and stocks of accountability capital. In authoritarian regimes, building second-order accountability through the accumulation of stocks of accountability is crucial for NGOs' survival and organisational development and as a path towards gaining first-order accountability. Drawing on a decade of fieldwork on child welfare NGOs in China from 2007 to 2017, we select three case studies with long operational trajectories to illustrate processes of crafting legitimacy and accountability. The research contributes empirically and theoretically to the understanding of accountability in NGOs in authoritarian states through the novel analytic framework and case study of China."

Active Ageing Index in Korea – Comparison with China and EU countries.,"Um, Jinpil; Zaidi, Asghar; Choi, Sung‐Jae",Asian Social Work & Policy Review,Wiley-Blackwell,POPULATION aging; INCOME distribution; PENSIONS; KOREA; ACTIVE aging,active ageing index; active aging; China; EU countries; healthy aging; Korea; population aging,"The evidence‐based policymaking relies on the use and robustness of the available data. Many conceptual and operational difficulties restrict this process, not least in making use of evidence to identify policy priorities. The Active Ageing Index (AAI), developed originally for the 28 European Union countries, offers a strong motivation in this respect. This paper reports on the development of the AAI for Korea, a country where speed and level of population aging is among the highest in the world. Drawing on the comparative analysis of the AAI results for Korea, China, and European countries, we find that Korea's AAI (35.3) is higher than the average of the AAI for all EU countries (33.9) but lower than China (37.3). Fitting Korea into the overall ranking with the EU countries and China (ranked 7), Korea is ranked 11, just behind Germany (10). The AAI results in Korea show that the employment domain performs extremely well compared with the EU countries, but other domains, especially ""Social participation"" and ""Independent, healthy and secure living,"" are achieving less favorable outcomes. High employment among the current cohorts of older workers in Korea can be attributed largely to the constraints of low pension income status."
"Actual Air Pollution, Environmental Transparency, and the Perception of Air Pollution in China.","Minggang Peng; Hui Zhang; Evans, Richard D.; Xiaohui Zhong; Kun Yang",Journal of Environment & Development,Sage Publications Inc.,AIR pollution; AIR pollutants; CHINA,actual air pollution; China; environmental transparency; multilevel ordered logistic model; perception of air pollution,"Using data from the China Social Survey 2013 and statistics from the Ministry of Environment Protection of China and the Institute of Public & Environment Affairs, this study empirically examines the relationship between actual and perceived air pollution and the moderating effect of environmental transparency on that relationship with a multilevel ordered logistic strategy. Estimations indicate a significant congruence of actual (both particulate matter less than 10 µm in diameter and sulfur dioxide) and perceived air pollution. More importantly, environmental transparency of local government is found to moderate the relationship between actual and perceived air pollution by neutralizing the halo effects and building more alert perceptions when local air quality deteriorates. Our findings not only challenge the work of identifying a mismatch of actual-perceived air pollution in some developed countries but also suggest that, apart from abating actual air pollution, environmental transparency should be emphasized and strengthened in institutional buildings to help address pollution challenges in developing countries."

To fight against environmental pollution more effectively, the Chinese government established the Ministry of Environmental Protection (MEP) in 2008. This study investigates the stock market reaction to this event and finds that, on average, listed firms in polluting industries experienced a statistically and economically significant negative abnormal return on the event date, which implies that the compliance costs of these polluting firms are expected to increase. In addition, this study finds that enterprises with different ownership styles and different political influence experienced different price reactions during the event window. More specifically, state-owned enterprises (SOEs) in general experienced a less negative abnormal return over different event windows, and provincial SOEs perform much better than central SOEs and sub-provincial SOEs."
Adult and child deprivation in Hong Kong.,"Saunders, Peter; Tang, Vera Mun‐yu",Social Policy & Administration,Wiley-Blackwell,POVERTY; SOCIAL policy; HONG Kong (China) -- Social conditions; SOCIAL conditions of children; POOR children; INCOME,child deprivation; consensual approach; deprivation; poverty,"There is growing interest in the application of Townsend's deprivation approach to provide estimates of poverty that more directly reflect the living standards of those on low income. The consensual approach is applied here using data from the second wave (conducted in 2015–2016) of the Trends and Implications of Social Disadvantages in Hong Kong survey. The article draws on a related study that identifies separate lists of items deemed ""necessary for all"" by a majority of adults (aged 18 years or older) and children (aged 10–17 years). Those unable to obtain at least three of these items are identified as deprived, and the profile of household deprivation is examined in terms of the family types most affected, age groups, and numbers of children. Further analysis focuses on the disparity between children identified as living in households identified as deprived according to information provided by adults and children whose deprivation status reflects their own views. Finally, the overlaps between deprivation and four measures of poverty—two objective and income based and two subjective and perception based—are examined and discussed. The results indicate that deprivation and poverty are different but that, however it is measured, more needs to be done to address poverty in Hong Kong, including further improvements in the coverage and adequacy of health service provision and social security benefits."
Advocacy in Action: China's Grassroots NGOs as Catalysts for Policy Innovation.,"Farid, May",Studies in Comparative International Development,Springer Nature,NONGOVERNMENTAL organizations; POLITICAL participation; AUTHORITARIANISM; BUREAUCRACY; CHINA -- Politics & government,China; Development; Governance; Grassroots NGOs; Policy,"How do small, grassroots NGOs influence a powerful authoritarian state and its policies? This paper presents data on instances of interaction between China's grassroots NGOs and party-state agencies through which NGOs are able to exert influence on policymaking and implementation by modeling innovations in action. The analysis begins by painting the backdrop against which policy influence occurs: a political context characterized by diminished bureaucratic capacity, policy discretion, and experimentation under hierarchy. It then presents the argument that collaboration between grassroots NGOs and local government agencies can act as a risk mitigation strategy for official innovation in a system of experimentation under hierarchy. Extensive longitudinal field research across six sub-national units shows convergence among grassroots NGOs on a conception of advocacy in action. This expanded conception of advocacy overcomes the dichotomy between advocacy and service delivery functions, and allows for observation of a fuller range of efforts that include 'obstructive' as well as 'instructive' advocacy. Globally, traditional channels of political participation are decreasing in availability and efficacy. This research shows how, as growing numbers of the populace organize to address social and environmental challenges through grassroots organizations, they open alternate channels of political participation, in turn refashioning state practice."
"Aid vs. ""Aid"": Foreign Aid in Mao‐Era China's Public Diplomacy.","Atkinson, Joel",Australian Journal of Politics & History,Wiley-Blackwell,"INTERNATIONAL economic assistance; GREAT Leap Forward, China, 1958-1961; CHINA -- Foreign economic relations; CHINA -- Politics & government; MAO, Zedong, 1893-1976",,"Historicising Chinese foreign‐aid thinking has become indispensable given China's increasing global role. This article examines a key aspect of this context: the Great Leap Forward and the emerging Sino‐Soviet split period (1958‐1961). The Peking Review is utilised as a window into official aid‐related discourses of the time. The article is organized around an aid vs. ""aid"" rhetorical and conceptual symmetry within the magazine. Aid is ultimately what Mao Zedong and other leaders intend audiences to code as pro‐development and prestigious. The greater the unreciprocated cost to the donor and the higher the embodied technology, the more helpful and prestigious the donor. At the same time, the more ideologically correct the recipient or donor, the greater its relative prestige in the equation. An ideologically correct recipient such as China deserves more help but needs it less, and accrues more prestige even as it gives comparatively less aid. ""Aid"" is the reverse image of aid in that it is harmful rather than helpful. But instead of being the opposite of prestigious, ""aid"" is powerful in a predatory, paper tiger‐like way. While this discourse reflects parochial concerns of the period, the underlying concepts are likely to continue to influence contemporary Chinese aid thinking and practices."
AIIB in the Liberal International Order.,"Professor, Matthew D Stephen Interim; Professor, David Skidmore",Chinese Journal of International Politics,Oxford University Press / USA,ECONOMICS; LIBERALISM; SOCIAL networks; CHINA; ASIAN Infrastructure Investment Bank,,"The rise of China raises fundamental questions about the future of the liberal international order (LIO) at a time when it is under ever more strain. Although China's focus for some years was on joining and participating in existing multilateral institutions, today China is increasingly building its own. Prominent among them is the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), launched in late 2014. Against the background of contending theoretical expectations, this article examines the extent to which the AIIB either reinforces or challenges the LIO and highlights what this tells us about China's broader relationship with the LIO. We provide a definition of the LIO that is based on its social purpose rather than on its formal characteristics. State-centric approaches offer insights into China's decision to engage in new institution building via the AIIB, but we argue that a focus on social purpose is necessary to assess the AIIB's broader implications for the LIO. We find that, while conforming in large measure to existing institutional models, the AIIB promotes China's integration into global social networks, strengthens state-led development pathways, and is associated with the Chinese norm of non-interference. The AIIB, thus, foreshadows the possibility of an institutionalised international order indifferent to liberalism. In sum, the AIIB reflects the tensions between the socialising effects of the LIO and China's growing externalisation of its own non-liberal, state-led model of political economy."
AIIB Membership for African Countries: Drawcards and Drawbacks.,"Prinsloo, Cyril",Global Policy,Wiley-Blackwell,DEFICIT financing; LOW-income countries; ASIA; ASIAN Infrastructure Investment Bank; ASIANS; FINANCIAL instruments; MIDDLE-income countries; INVESTMENT banking,,"The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank's (AIIB) establishment was inspired by the significant infrastructure investment needs that Asian countries will experience over the coming decade. African countries face an equally daunting challenge: the estimated infrastructure finance deficit is between $68 and $108 billion annually. Several African countries have already joined the AIIB (Egypt, Ethiopia, Madagascar and Sudan), some have been approved to join (Benin, Djibouti, Guinea, Ivory Coast, Rwanda and Tunisia), and select others are designated as 'prospective founding members' of this new bank, but are yet to join (Algeria, Ghana, Kenya, Libya, Morocco and South Africa). AIIB membership offers an alluring proposition for African economies: low‐cost finance from a new source. Yet its limited support for technical capacity‐building and financial instruments for low‐income countries, outside of Asia, makes membership less desirable for many African countries. This brief essay analyses the primary motivations, and the benefits and challenges for African countries in joining the AIIB. It surmises that middle‐income African countries are more likely to benefit from AIIB membership than their low‐income peers. While AIIB membership for all African countries is feasible, the Bank's lack of technical capacity, combined with the limited financing options, especially the lack of financial instruments that cater to the developmental needs of LICs suggest that membership may have limited benefits for many African countries."

Airborne prawns and decayed rice: food politics in Wartime Chongqing.,"LEE, Seung-Joon",Journal of Modern Chinese History,Taylor & Francis Ltd,,Banquet; Chongqing; food entitlement; restaurant; rice; wartime prohibition; World War II,"This article explores the multilayered dimensions of food politics in wartime Chongqing. A substantial number of wartime Chongqing dwellers were migrants who flocked to the city, having evacuated from coastal China to follow the Nationalists after the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War. They could not simply be called refugees. Rather, they were sophisticated urbanites known by Chongqing natives as ""downriver folks"" who brought their political awareness and cultural tastes to the new wartime capital. Some introduced their sumptuous dining culture to Chongqing, thereby provoking a public sense of deprivation, while others brought organizational skills with which to turn public discontent into a political issue. This article argues that an increasing sense of deprivation stemming from the deterioration of the food situation in the city, if seemingly less significant than massive rural famine, became more consequential in the long run than any other political issue in the subsequent Civil War years."

Our understanding of alignment encompasses the attitude of creating an authoritative line of discourse, which in turn triggers the responsive alignment of the receivers with the decision makers. We believe that alignment is a fundamental concept to understand how linguistic politeness operates in political monologues such as gong'gao. Such texts are rich in forms of deference such as honorifics and other ritual phrases used towards Chinese politicians. The reason why such forms of politeness deserve special attention in language and politics is that they are not interpersonal, and their use correlates with implicit communication."
All the Emperor's Men? Conflicts and Power-Sharing in Imperial China.,"Xi, Tianyang",Comparative Political Studies,Sage Publications Inc.,MINORITIES; GOVERNORS; LEGISLATIVE bodies; SOCIAL stability; CHINA,bureaucratic selection; internal conflicts; loyalty-versus-competence; power-sharing,"Autocracies often rely on power-sharing to maintain political survival. The literature, however, does not provide an adequate explanation for why autocratic regimes differ in the capability to enforce power-sharing. Drawing on the case of imperial China in the Qing dynasty (1644-1911), this article argues that institutionalized bureaucratic system may be an arguably credible mechanism for facilitating power-sharing. Examining the pattern of bureaucratic turnovers in the Qing period shows that the sanctions and promotions for provincial governors were significantly affected by the level of internal armed conflicts. Favoritism was granted to Manchus, the ruling minority group, for the promotion toward the top level. With the presence of armed conflicts at the province level, however, the rulers were induced to select Han elites from the majority group, as governors. These results are consistent with the logic of power-sharing by virtue of a loyalty-versus-competence trade-off in bureaucratic selections."

The Saudis took issue with the Canadian foreign minister's call to release human rights activists from prison, whereas China was angry at Canada's arrest of a senior Chinese executive on an extradition request from the United States. These incidents should not be viewed as isolated aberrations. Authoritarian regimes seem increasingly emboldened to lash out at countries that displease them, including allies of the United States. But Ottawa has succeeded in rallying considerable international support for its position in the China dispute, suggesting that while Canada may be exposed, it is not destined to be alone."

In Africa, the Forum on China–Africa Cooperation provides the official framings for forms of development assistance to the continent, with financial forms of aid available through the New Development Bank and the China–Africa Development Bank (CADFund). This article explores how Chinese international development assistance has influenced South Africa's economic growth and development strategies and is reshaping South Africa as ""gateway"" to Africa and continental leader. Special economic zones (SEZs) have become a prioritised form of BRICS development collaboration particularly in terms of Chinese trade and investment expansionism into Africa through South Africa. Chinese international development assistance and foreign direct investment in South Africa in particular are very notable and have been strengthened during the Chinese official state visit prior to the Johannesburg BRICS Summit in 2018. The article critically analyses the development policy discourse on BRICS spearheading an alternative model of South–South international cooperation by examining the Coega SEZ in South Africa, hailed as the most SEZ in Africa.

After introducing the concept of grand strategy, Part I reviews each of the books individually in sequence, outlining their scope, contents, and contributions. Part II then integrates the contributions of each of the volumes into a broader discussion relating to four pertinent issues: American perspectives on ""Asia""; international relations (IR) theory; American strategic culture; and the rise of China, before concluding. The books under review are to differing degrees orientated toward one of the core IR theory paradigms: realism (Green), liberalism (Campbell), and constructivism/critical approaches (Kang). As such, read together, they contribute to a multi-faceted theoretical understanding of US grand strategy in the Indo Pacific that will be of significant value to both scholars and practitioners."
Amount Rather than Animal vs Plant Protein Intake Is Associated with Skeletal Muscle Mass in Community-Dwelling Middle-Aged and Older Chinese Adults: Results from the Guangzhou Nutrition and Health Study.,"Li, Cui-yu; Fang, Ai-ping; Ma, Wen-jun; Wu, Shang-ling; Li, Chun-lei; Chen, Yu-ming; Zhu, Hui-lian",Journal of the Academy of Nutrition & Dietetics,Elsevier B.V.,LONGITUDINAL method; LOGISTIC regression analysis; CROSS-sectional method; CHINA; ANALYSIS of covariance; ANIMALS; BODY composition; CONFIDENCE intervals; INGESTION; GOVERNMENT policy on nutrition; NUTRITIONAL requirements; PLANT proteins; PROTEINS in human nutrition; COMMUNITY-based social services; INDEPENDENT living; SARCOPENIA; SKELETAL muscle; DESCRIPTIVE statistics; PHOTON absorptiometry; ODDS ratio; MIDDLE age; OLD age,Animal protein; Dietary protein; Plant protein; Sarcopenia; Skeletal muscle mass,"Current literature does not indicate if the amount and animal vs plant protein are equally important in the prevention of muscle loss in middle-aged and older Chinese adults. The aim of the study was to examine the associations between amount or animal vs plant protein and skeletal muscle mass in Chinese adults aged 40 to 80 years. A cross-sectional analysis of a prospective, community-based cohort was performed. Participants included 1,044 men and 2,169 women aged 40 to 80 years from the Guangzhou Nutrition and Health Study 2011-2013 with body composition measurements by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. The skeletal muscle index (SMI) was defined as appendicular skeletal muscle mass divided by body weight. Participants in the lowest quartile of the sex-specific SMI were considered to have low muscle mass (LMM). Analyses of covariance were performed to estimate the SMI across quintiles of relative dietary intake of total, animal, and plant protein and the ratio of animal-to-plant protein. Logistic regression models were applied to assess the associations between quintiles of protein intake and LMM. The SMI increased significantly across quintiles of relative dietary intake of total, animal, and plant protein (all P trends<0.001). Odds ratios (95% CIs) for LMM among participants in the highest (vs lowest) quintile were 0.3 (0.2, 0.4) for total protein, 0.3 (0.2, 0.5) for animal protein, and 0.4 (0.3, 0.7) for plant protein, respectively (all P trends<0.001). However, the ratio of animal-to-plant protein was not associated with either the SMI or the presence of LMM. Higher dietary intakes of total, animal, and plant protein, regardless of the ratio of animal-to-plant protein, are associated with greater skeletal muscle mass in community-dwelling middle-aged and older Chinese adults with a mean protein intake above the current recommendation for protein of 0.8 g/kg per day."
An Application of Expected Utility Modeling and Game Theory in IR: Assessment of International Bargaining on Iran's Nuclear Program.,"Özdamar, Özgür",All Azimuth: A Journal of Foreign Policy & Peace,"Ihsan Dogramaci Peace Foundation, Center for Foreign Policy & Peace Research",GAME theory; INTERNATIONAL relations; COLLECTIVE bargaining; UTILITY theory; JOINT Comprehensive Plan of Action (2015),dynamic median voter model with coercion; Expected utility theory; forecasting; game theory; Iran; nuclear program; the Middle East,"This article provides an introduction to the theoretical underpinnings of expected utility and game theory approaches in IR studies. It goes on to explore their application to a specific research subject, international bargaining on Iran's nuclear program. In this application, the article presents forecasts about Iran's nuclear program using a game theoretic, bounded rationality model called the expected utility model (Bueno de Mesquita 2002). Three analyses were made in December 2005, September 2006 and March 2007. All three forecasts appear to be in line with real-life developments regarding the issue. The results show that Iran has been losing international support since the analyses started, and the last forecast suggests a pro-US position supported by all major international actors. Also, all three analyses suggest that Russian and Chinese support is vital to curb the Iranian nuclear program."
An asymmetric analysis of the J‐curve effect in the commodity trade between China and the US.,"Bahmani‐Oskooee, Mohsen; Bose, Niloy; Zhang, Yun",World Economy,Wiley-Blackwell,BALANCE of trade; FOREIGN exchange rates; CHINA; COMMODITY futures; COMMERCIAL products,asymmetric analysis; China; commodity trade; exchange rate; the US,"This paper follows a non‐linear ARDL error‐correction approach to examine the presence of the J‐curve in the commodity‐level trade between the United States and China. The analysis disaggregates the US–China trade flows by commodities and separately examines the trade balance responses of 97 commodities to the changes in the real yuan–US$ exchange rates. The analysis at the commodity level alleviates potential aggregation bias that is present in earlier studies offering little evidence for long‐run asymmetric effects of exchange rate on the China–US trade balance. We find strong support for short‐run asymmetric effects in the case of two‐third of the commodities, whereas significant long‐run asymmetric effects are present in the case of one‐third of the commodities including those commodities which command large shares in the China–US trade."
An institutional analysis of China's South-to-North water diversion.,"Wang, Mark; Chen Li",Thesis Eleven,"Sage Publications, Ltd.",AUTHORITARIANISM; WATER transfer; YANGTZE River (China); WATER management; WATER diversion,China; fragmented authoritarianism; institutional adaptation; inter-basin transfer; middle route; water management,"The availability of and demand for water in China is an extreme case of uneven distribution in time and space. In response, the South to North Water Diversion (SNWD) project, the largest inter-basin water transfer scheme in the world, channels large amounts of fresh water from the Yangtze River in southern China to the more arid and industrialised north. In order to keep the SNWD project running smoothly, a comprehensive governance system has been implemented and innovative institutional arrangements have been created to facilitate the transfer of water itself. By taking the SNWD project's Middle Route as one case study and drawing on primary and secondary data, this article examines the project's emerging institutional arrangements. The article outlines the establishment of new institutions for the SNWD project with high administrative rankings at both central and local levels, the encouragement of inter-department cooperation, the adoption of a market mechanism and the integration of market functions into administrative functions. We argue that these institutional arrangements have to some extent overcome common challenges in water governance in China, including an engineering-heavy approach and what Chinese commentators have traditionally called the problem of water being managed by multiple government ministries and municipal authorities as the common metaphor of 'nine dragons managing the water'. Our findings have significant implications for understanding the continuing evolution of water governance in China."

Anti‐dumping duty circumvention through trade rerouting: Evidence from Chinese exporters.,"Liu, Xuepeng; Shi, Huimin",World Economy,Wiley-Blackwell,ANTIDUMPING duties; INTERNATIONAL trade; TARIFF; COMMERCE; TRANSSHIPMENT; CERTIFICATES of origin; EXPORTERS; CHINA; UNITED States,anti‐dumping; circumvention; US‐China trade,"We study the evasion of US anti‐dumping duties by some Chinese exporters through trade rerouting via third countries or regions. Using detailed monthly trade data reported by China and the US Customs during the period of 2002–06, we find that US anti‐dumping actions against China lead to a stronger positive correlation between US imports from third countries and Chinese exports to the same third countries. Such a positive correlation is more pronounced for the products subject to anti‐dumping duties (treatment groups) than similar products not subject to these duties (control groups). The evidence is stronger for less‐differentiated products whose certificates of origins are easier to be modified and is stronger for third countries where the rerouting cost is low. These findings are consistent with a trade rerouting story, rather than a simple story of trade diversion (i.e., increase in some third countries' imports from China) and trade deflection (i.e., increase in some third‐country exports to the US). We also rule out other alternative stories, consider prior production in third countries and concurrent anti‐dumping actions against China or third countries, pay a particular attention to the many zero trade flows in the monthly level data and check the robustness to using an alternative control group and quarterly data, etc."

This is a neglected topic both in international relations and research on regional security in the Asia Pacific. This assessment reveals new developments in regional engagement between the ANZUS states and the Asia-Pacific. It finds that despite a shared language, broadly similar regional goals, and a need for interoperability; the ANZUS alliance itself does not appear to be driving closer military coordination on HADR. This article finds instead that HADR is being used to build new informal security networks that combine traditional and non-traditional security threats as a form of soft balancing against China."

Korea, prima facie, is a case that has the likely potential to erupt into an open conflict between China and the United States. Situated against the broad context of great power entanglement on the Peninsula, this paper examines the convergence, as well as divergence, of interests and strategic objectives for both China and the United States in terms of areas of cooperation and competition. It argues that their shared aversion to a war, and the complex, multilateral nature of the matter, distinguishes Korea from other disputes, particularly Taiwan and the South China Sea. Korea, therefore, is not at the center of a Sino‐US Thucydides Trap. Nevertheless, Sino‐US competition to shape the future of the strategic landscape of the Peninsula will undoubtedly continue and might even intensify."
Archaeology and politics in China: Historical paradigm and identity construction in museum exhibitions.,"Shelach-Lavi, Gideon",China Information,"Sage Publications, Ltd.",CHINA. Guo jia bo wu guan; ARCHAEOLOGY; MUSEUM exhibits,archaeological museums; Beijing; construction of identities; cultural policy; historical narratives; Liaoning,"In China, as in many other modern and contemporary states, the past is often used to inform public opinions and legitimate the political regime. This article examines two examples of archaeological exhibitions in China: at the National Museum of China (中国国家博物馆) in Beijing and the Liaoning Provincial Museum (辽宁省博物馆) in Shenyang. It discusses the development and change over time in the content of these archaeological exhibitions, the way they were organized and presented to the public, and the explanations that accompanied the prehistoric artefacts. I argue that the way the past, and in particular the distant, prehistoric and proto-historic past, is presented in Chinese museums reveals a process of entrenchment of the standardized narrative of Chinese history, with a powerful sense of connection and continuity between the past, no matter how distant, and the present. I also argue that although the general outline of the historical trajectory of the 'Chinese civilization' is universally accepted, small variations in the way it is presented and the different emphases of the two exhibitions can inform us about various ways of constructing local and national identities in China during the 20th century and up to the current time."
"Arctic SAR and the ""security dilemma"".","Byers, Michael; Covey, Nicole",International Journal,Sage Publications Inc.,SEARCH & rescue operations; CANADIAN military; CANADA -- Foreign relations,Arctic; Canada; China; Russia; search and rescue; security; security dilemma,"This article explains how search and rescue (SAR) equipment and personnel can strengthen Canada's Arctic security without contributing to a classic ""security dilemma""—whereby a perceived military buildup by one state leads to a responsive buildup by another state, and so on into an arms race. This is because Arctic SAR involves dual-use assets that can fulfill most existing and reasonably foreseeable Arctic security roles as a secondary mission. Avoiding a security dilemma is key with regards to Canada–Russia relations. In the Arctic arena, Russia sees itself surrounded by North Atlantic Treaty Organization states during a period of considerable tension with those same states elsewhere in the world. Although most of the responsibility for that tension lies with Russia, it is still in Canada's interest to avoid feeding Russia's Arctic uncertainties and insecurities, since regional military buildups can cause instability and even conflict."
Are Children from Divorced Single-Parent Families Disadvantaged? New Evidence from the China Family Panel Studies.,"Zhang, Chunni",Chinese Sociological Review,Taylor & Francis Ltd,PANEL analysis; WESTERN society; CHINA; SINGLE-parent families; DIVORCE; SINGLE parents; PARENTS; FAMILIES,,"Since the beginning of the twenty-first century, divorced single parenthood has become more prevalent in China. Nevertheless, divorced single parenthood and its impact on child outcomes have not been studied as much in China as in the West. Most studies in Western societies have reported that divorce and single parenthood are associated with disadvantaged child outcomes. This has been attributed in part to the prevalence of divorce among parents with low socioeconomic status and decreased child monitoring when one parent is absent. In China, however, there are several buffering mechanisms that may reduce the negative impact of divorce on children. Using data from four waves of the China Family Panel Studies, this study examines the effects of divorce and single parenthood on children's academic performance and subjective wellbeing. The results show that children living with divorced single mothers performed as well as children from intact families, whereas children living with divorced single fathers and stepparents were disadvantaged in academic performance and subjective wellbeing. Frequent quarrels between parents in intact families also had a negative impact on child outcomes."

We take LA as a case study because China's and Japan's recent (re-)engagement there began almost simultaneously in the early 2000s, and has developed against the background of domestic leadership transitions, growing demands for energy and markets, as well as international political agendas in which LA might play a key role.

Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press], the article suggests three indicators by which to measure the extent to which China and Japan might perceive each other as rivals. Drawing on content analysis of a range of Chinese- and Japanese-language official writing, news reports, and academic analysis, the article argues that, despite some media representation of China and Japan as competitors for resources and power in LA, in fact mutual perceptions concerning rivalry have not affected LA policy decisions of these two countries."
Are Chinese college graduates satisfied with serving as village officials? An evaluation with nationwide survey data.,"Gao, Yanyan; Zang, Leizhen; Sun, Jun",Journal of Asian Public Policy,Taylor & Francis Ltd,,Chinese government; graduate village officials (大学生村官); Job satisfaction; nationwide survey data; ordered-probit model,"To promote rural socio-economic development, the Chinese government has encouraged college graduates to work in villages since 2005, bringing about a novel nonmarket-determined job called graduate village official. We use nationwide survey data to analyse the determinants of job satisfaction for graduate village officials. Empirical results show that the job satisfaction of graduate village officials is basically not determined by their personal traits, but by social contexts as well as job factors. Salary, occupational pride, adaption to rural work, supports from leaders and job prospects impact more on graduate village officials' job satisfaction than other factors. Unreasonable policy management and implementation contribute to graduate village officials' job dissatisfaction. Finally, we briefly discuss potential policy implications of our findings."
Are Street-Level Bureaucrats in China Hardnosed Cops or Consultants? An Institutional Account of Policing Behavior in Autocracy.,"Zang, Xiaowei; Pratt, John",Journal of Contemporary China,Taylor & Francis Ltd,CIVIL law; DICTATORSHIP; POLICE; LAW enforcement; CIVIL service; CHINA,,"Chengguan (城管) is part of the stability maintenance regime specializing in civil law enforcement in China. Many protests today have occurred in reaction to Chengguan harsh enforcement rather than police action. Using survey data (n = 1,721) from China, the authors found both severity and leniency in Chengguan law enforcement. The authors also found that Chengguan enforcement styles are largely conciliatory rather than legalistic, and that Chengguan officers are more likely to be harsh during politically important periods than during politically unimportant periods. The authors explain the temporal variation in Chengguan severity and leniency with three institutional factors of autocracy: resource constraints, upward accountability, and the politics of ritual events. This study offers a new account of law enforcement in China."

This study explores how the intersubjective perception of media-disseminated narratives of US–China interdependence may shape the likelihood of war. In two randomized online experiments, we manipulated ordinary Americans' perceptions of US–China relations with real CNN video clips that narrated a US–China power transition as either positive or zero sum. Across both experiments, more zero-sum narratives boosted perceived US–China competition, increasing intergroup mistrust, anger and subsequent desires for a tougher China policy. The second study also revealed that individual differences in nationalism and uncertainty avoidance moderated the effects of the perception of media narratives on mistrust and anger. Viewers actively interpret media they are exposed to. These findings empirically demonstrate the power of narratives: specifically, they reveal the psychological mechanisms linking structural changes in the balance of power to the individual-level processes that may determine great power war and peace."
Are there Bubbles in the Defence Sector of China's Stock Market (2005–2016)?

Meanwhile, China's stock market has suffered from dramatic fluctuations. This article, therefore, attempts to break new ground on an empirical research agenda to detect bubbles in the defence sector of China's stock market and how these bubbles can be impacted by the entire stock market and defence industry. To explain this issue, sequential unit root tests are introduced to investigate the existence of bubbles in the defence sector using monthly frequency data from China's stock market from January 2005 to June 2016. The empirical results show strong evidence of explosive behaviours in the defence sector during the past decade. Moreover, the number of bubbles has changed greatly when accounting for the entire stock market. The empirical results indicate that bubbles in the middle of 2006 and at the end of 2014 were driven by the defence industry because of the sharp increase of military expenditure and the release of innovative defence reforms. Finally, we suggest that the government could control the annual budget increase at a steady pace and implement defence reforms by carrying out experimental units gradually."

More broadly, the relevance of ASEAN in these polarizing times has come into question and subregional arrangements, such as the Ayeyawady-Chaopraya-Mekong Economic Cooperation Strategy (ACMECS) are emerging. Recent incidents point to growing Chinese assertiveness in the South China Sea. A reported agreement with Cambodia to build a strategic outpost on the Gulf of Thailand has drawn sharp criticism from Washington. But it is unclear how able or willing Southeast Asian governments are to push back since they view China as a critical economic partner. As several Southeast Asian leaders contemplate retirement, economic security is a common element in the legacies they envision."

Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his immediate predecessors have long supported the US military presence in Afghanistan as a means to stabilise the country, protect the anti-Taliban government and provide security for India's development projects in the country. However, taken together with the fiscal deficit of state (provincial) governments and the public-sector borrowing requirement (PSBR), which is government-guaranteed debt, the total fiscal deficit has been estimated to be close to 9% of national income. This assistance to Maldives comes against the background of the voting out of a pro-China government and the election of a pro-India government in the Arabian Sea island nation. China is also expected to step up FDI in India, with several Chinese companies having already established production facilities in telecoms and related industries, although the bigger beneficiaries of the US-China trade war have been China's smaller neighbours including Bangladesh, Thailand and Vietnam."

Now these super powers are going to make grouping on space for getting hegemony not only on earth but also in space. As a result, the challenges in space have triggered and magnified the security dilemma for the South Asian rivals, interconnecting China, India, and Pakistan in the context of an international security complex.

Asian Territorial Disputes and the 1951 San Francisco Peace Treaty: The Case of Dokdo.,"Schwartz, Thomas; Yoo, John",Chinese Journal of International Law,Oxford University Press / USA,PEACE treaties; TREATIES; WORLD War II; LEGAL instruments; JAPAN; ARCHIVAL materials,,"This Article analyzes whether the 1951 San Francisco Peace Treaty, the only multilateral international agreement that draws borders in East Asia, resolves the longstanding dispute over Dokdo between Korea and Japan. It uses the dispute to draw larger lessons about the nature of the treaty that ended World War II in the Pacific and how it structured the peace in Asia differently from that in Europe. It uses U.S. archival material to reconstruct the history of the making of the Treaty, which continues to be the most significant international legal instrument governing post-WWII Asia. Although the Republic of Korea demonstrated a long history of control over Dokdo, Japan annexed the island on February 22, 1905. Japan places much importance on the Treaty's silence because the Treaty otherwise required Japan to relinquish the territories it acquired before and during World War II. After the fall of the Nationalist government in China, the United States decided to rebuild Japan into a strong regional ally, and consequently negotiated a generous peace treaty with its former WWII enemy. This Article concludes that the Treaty left Dokdo, along with other important issues, open for future resolution."

Spatial panel demand estimates are presented for three joined spatial units using a fixed-coefficient spatial lag model based on a two-step efficient GMM estimator. Spatial autoregression estimates are next presented for 1991–2015, founded on alternative kinds of country connectivities, such as contiguity, inverse distance, discrete distance, and power-projection considerations. Finally, 11 select countries' demands for defense equations are estimated using seemingly unrelated regressions. From alternative perspectives, these estimated models indicate how Asia-Pacific countries respond to the defense spending of other countries. In the spatial runs, free riding is prevalent despite the growing military might of China, which apparently is not generally viewed as a threat. For the sample period, the projection of Chinese or American power is a relevant spatial factor. The main threat is reflected in non-U.S. allies' reaction to U.S. allies' defense spending during 1991–2015 and to Chinese defense spending after 2002."

Through a comparative case study, it shows that inter-organizational relation is hard to start up; conflicting policies, incompatible procedures, power disparity, low issue salience, and lack of perceived interdependence may separately and jointly affect collaboration performance. The presence of vertical meta-governance plays a critical role in turning the tide; however, its presence is tied up with other factors such as high issue salience or bottom-up appeal. In addition, the highest level of performance not only depends on vertical meta-governance but also on horizontal meta-governance."

Assessing public opinion's influence on foreign policy: the case of China's assertive maritime behavior.,"Chubb, Andrew",Asian Security,Taylor & Francis Ltd,PUBLIC opinion; NATIONALISM; CHINESE Communist Party; CHINA,,"English-language analysis of Chinese foreign policy has often cited nationalist public opinion as a key driver of Beijing's recent assertive maritime conduct. Yet these important conjectures have not been systematically tested. How can we know whether public opinion has been driving an authoritarian state's foreign policy? What are some cases in which concern about popular nationalism may have influenced Beijing's behavior in disputed maritime spaces? To answer these questions, this article constructs a methodological framework for assessing the likely impact of public opinion on particular instances of state action. Applying this to five cases typical of China's on-water policy in the South and East China Seas since 2007 indicates that popular nationalism has had little to do with China's assertive turn on its maritime periphery."
Assessing the Effectiveness of Security Assurances on the DPRK's Nuclear Issue.,Yi Ding; Dingli Shen,Korean Journal of Defense Analysis,Korea Institute for Defense Analyses,,China; DPRK; effectiveness; nuclear nonproliferation; security assurance; Soviet Union; United States,"In the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK)'s case of nuclear proliferation, less attention has been paid to the role of security assurances. This paper seeks to assess the role of security assurances for the DPRK provided by the UN, the Soviet Union, China, and the United States and to figure out why these assurances are less effective to bridle its nuclear ambition. It argues that an effective security assurance for nuclear non-proliferation should meet at least two conditions. Firstly the security assurance should be credible, which can be realized by being publicized, legally binding, and infusing with further commitments. Secondly, the security assurance tailored to the unique features of the target state's concerns is more likely to be effective. Using this set of criteria, the only moderately effective assurance is that provided by the Soviet Union. The general security assurance of the UN is neither legally binding nor specifically targeted. The alliance with China exists only on paper as Pyongyang believes Beijing is reluctant to fulfill its obligation as an ally. The United States is taking a capricious attitude on the DPRK and none of its security assurances are legalized or address its major concern of regime survival. These may help explain why security assurances failed to prevent the DPRK from acquiring nuclear weapons."

Challenging this conventional view, this article examines how immigrants make use of their transnational ties to foster their political participation in the host state. This exploration is conducted through our study of the political participation of Vietnamese and Chinese immigrants in Taiwan. Our research finds that transnational ties are politicized by the mainstream political parties. However, such politicization does not necessarily restrict immigrants' agency and their sociopolitical space for political participation. Their transnational ties constitute a dynamic sociopolitical field in which these maintained connections are acted upon and give rise to a variety of strategies for responding to issues affecting their interests."

In addition, cultural institutes can provide additional business opportunities that lead to positive economic side effects such as increases in trade and foreign direct investment (FDI). In this study, gravity models were used to analyse the data for the Goethe Institut (Germany), the Cervantes Institute (Spain) and the Confucius Institute (China) to identify any stylised international patterns of the documented economic effects. The study finds significant positive effects on bilateral trade and FDI outflows for all three programmes, along with two important (i) the effects are stronger for non‐advanced economies and (ii) the effects are substantially larger on FDI than on trade. These results suggest that cultural institutes can be an effective policy tool in promoting FDI outflows, with the strongest effect realised when a home country locates its cultural institutes in host countries with developing economies. Importantly, results also suggest that the Chinese government's approach to extend its soft power through rapid expansion of Confucius Institutes worldwide has not been as successful as the efforts by the German Goethe Institut in increasing trade and FDI."
Asymmetric Mutual Dependence between the State and Capitalists in China.,"Zhang, Changdong",Politics & Society,Sage Publications Inc.,COOPTATION; CAPITALISM; TAXATION; GOVERNMENT revenue; CHINA; BARGAINING power,co-optation via deterrence; mutual dependence; tax state transition; taxation,"China has for almost four decades been experiencing a market transition and an associated tax state transition, leading to the emergence of capitalists who increasingly control economic resources and serve as important sources of tax revenue. Some theories suggest that these changes should give capitalists political power. From the perspective of the taxation institution, using a mechanism-based case study, this article investigates whether China's emerging capitalists have gained bargaining power with the party-state. Findings suggest that hidden bargaining, patron-clientelism, legislature co-optation, and legal repression constrain their bargaining power. The underinstitutionalized taxation system has co-opted the capitalists through patronage and, more important, deterrence, thereby building an asymmetric mutual dependence between the local state and capital owners."
Asymmetrical Interdependence and Sanction: China's Economic Retaliation over South Korea's THAAD Deployment.,"YANG, FLORENCE WEN-TING",Issues & Studies,World Scientific Publishing Company,SANCTIONS (International law); ECONOMIC development; POWER (Social sciences); CHINA -- Foreign economic relations; KOREA (South) -- Foreign relations -- 2002-,Asymmetrical interdependence; China–South Korea relations; economic sanctions; the THAAD system,"Since China's economic rise, there has been an upsurge of cases demonstrating that the country has translated its increasing economic capabilities into political influence over other states. The focus of this paper is to investigate the case of China's economic sanctions on South Korea in response to its Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) deployment. Its goal is to deepen our understanding of how China has employed economic coercion in order to alter the policies of other states. China's economic sanctions have included intentional ones like the Hallyu ban, a ban on tourism, non-tariff measures, the shutting down of Lotte Marts, and the fomenting of anti-Korean sentiment in its official media. There is however insufficient evidence to prove that these boycott movements and reductions in direct investment on the part of Chinese companies are government-mandated sanctions and not simply the choice of individual actors. Our findings indicate that due to its asymmetrical interdependence on China, South Korea was more vulnerable to economic sanctions and thus more likely to make political concessions."
Asymmetrical rivalry between China and Japan in Africa: to what extent has Sino-Japan rivalry become a global phenomenon?,"Hirono, Miwa",Pacific Review,Taylor & Francis Ltd,FOREIGN investments; HEGEMONY; CHINA-Japan relations; ECONOMIC opportunities; ECONOMIC conditions in China,Africa; aid; foreign direct investment; peacekeeping; rivalry; Sino-Japanese relations,"To what extent is China–Japan rivalry a global phenomenon, and what is the nature of the rivalry they engage in outside their own region? Literature on Sino-Japanese rivalry abounds, but it pays scant attention to the relevance of the rivalry outside East Asia. This article argues that Sino-Japanese rivalry has indeed become a global phenomenon, that various forms of the rivalry are evident in Africa, and that they are mostly of an asymmetrical nature. Quantitatively, China's contribution to Africa is far greater than that of Japan, with the exception of foreign direct investment (FDI). Qualitatively, though, Japan has a stronger sense of the rivalry than China has, revealing a psychological aspect to the asymmetry as well. Contextually, the types of activity that Chinese and Japanese actors carry out in Africa are not necessarily the same, which makes the rivalry all the more asymmetrical. The rivalry has become more apparent recently, not only because of the rise of China but also because of a change in the meaning of 'Africa' – from a region of 'poverty' and 'hunger' to a region of 'economic opportunities'. That said, Africa – to a greater or lesser degree in each of its countries – still suffers from conflict and instability. As a result, the ability of Japan and China to exert power and influence throughout Africa is somewhat restricted."
At Africa's expense? Disaggregating the employment effects of Chinese mining operations in sub-Saharan Africa.,"Wegenast, Tim; Krauser, Mario; Strüver, Georg; Giesen, Juliane",World Development,Elsevier B.V.,UNEMPLOYMENT; JOB creation; LABOR market; EMPLOYMENT in foreign countries; CHINESE investments; MINERAL industries; COMPETITIVE advantage in business,China; Mining; Natural resources; Sub-Saharan Africa; Unemployment,"Highlights • In SSA, Chinese-controlled mines are associated with more local unemployment relative to non-Chinese mining operations. • Citizens' beliefs that Chinese firms are taking local jobs contribute to a negative image of China within mining regions. • Chinese companies' competitive advantage in the use of expatriate labor may explain our findings. Abstract China's increasing investments in African countries have attracted considerable media attention and are the subject of scholarly debate. However, the socioeconomic impacts of China's presence in Africa remain poorly understood. While some case studies maintain that Chinese projects have an enclave character and have largely failed to promote economic spillovers and local employment, others claim that Chinese activities have in fact encouraged infrastructural development and local economic activity. Focusing on the labor market effects of foreign mining investments in Africa, this article examines whether Chinese-controlled companies generate fewer local jobs compared to non-Chinese mining operations. Theoretically, we argue that—due to a competitive advantage in the employment of expatriate workers and a lower readiness to invest in local skill formation—Chinese firms are less likely to foster regional employment. Relying on novel data on the control-rights regimes of diamond, gold, and copper mines and georeferenced information from Afrobarometer surveys, we test the effect of mining contractors' nationality on local employment rates. Our individual-level logistic models show that respondents living close to Chinese mining areas are more likely to report being unemployed compared to individuals living in the vicinity of non-Chinese mining operations. Times-series cross-sectional estimations employing district-level data from the Demographic and Health Surveys for 20 sub-Saharan countries over the period 1997–2015 corroborate these findings. Furthermore, we find evidence that negative perceptions of China among indigenous populations are largely driven by the belief that Chinese workers are crowding out local employment."
At the Roots of Labour Activism: Chinese and Cambodian Garment Workers in Comparative Perspective.,"Franceschini, Ivan",Journal of Contemporary Asia,Taylor & Francis Ltd,LABOR movement; MINIMUM wage; COMPARATIVE studies; PLURALISM; CLOTHING industry; CLOTHING workers,Cambodia; China; labour law; labour protest; trade unions; wages,"In China extensive, co-ordinated strikes such as those that have taken place in Cambodia in recent years remain rare, with most protests initiated by Chinese workers contained inside single factories or industrial zones. Also, while Cambodian workers often mobilise for their interests and broader policy issues, such as the determination of the minimum wage, Chinese workers largely limit themselves to protests against violations of their legal rights. How can these different patterns of labour activism be explained? Through factory gate surveys and interviews conducted during the summer of 2016 in a sample of Hong Kong-owned garment factories in Dongguan and Phnom Penh, this study provides a comparative analysis of the root causes of labour activism in China and Cambodia. In particular, the article focuses on three elements that play an important role in determining labour activism: the expectations of the workers regarding wages; the workers' perception of the labour law and the legal system; and trade union pluralism."
Ausländische Direktinvestitionen in Deutschland – die große Angst vor China.,"Görg, Holger",Zeitschrift fur Wirtschaftspolitik,De Gruyter,FOREIGN investments -- Government policy; INTERNATIONAL trade; CONSOLIDATION & merger of corporations; ECONOMIC policy; GERMANY; GERMANY -- Economic conditions,,The current discussion in German policy circles suggests a strong scepticism towards foreign takeovers of German firms. This essay takes issue with this. It is firstly argued that Germany in actual fact receives relatively little inward investment. The essay then discusses the potential benefits from inward FDI which could also benefit the German economy. It then briefly reflects on the German policy initiatives which seem to be based on a fear of investment from China – though it is not clear at all what this fear is based on.
Australia And China: understanding the reality check.,"Medcalf, Rory",Australian Journal of International Affairs,Taylor & Francis Ltd,SOCIAL security; INTERNATIONAL relations -- Government policy; DEBATES & debating; BEIJING (China); AUSTRALIA-China relations,Australia-China relations; China; foreign interference; security,"Between 2016 and 2018, Australia's perceptions of China underwent a significant reality check, with global implications. Australia has been a first mover in pushing back against Chinese foreign interference, including via new foreign influence and interference laws. The recalibration of Australia-China relations, and the events and policy debate that proceeded it, is instructive for other countries seeking to respond to the more assertive and coercive elements of Chinese foreign policy. This article sets out the drivers of Australia's reality check, presents a chronology of key events, and examines how Canberra can now move relations with Beijing forward under the conditions of the new normal that has been established."

Normally seen as very slow-moving and hard to alter, senior officials' attitudes towards digital changes have recently begun to alter in more substantial ways in Australia. We review first a considerable reappraisal of the priority given to digital changes by top public service managers. This cultural shift has followed on from tech-lead disruptive societal changes affecting most areas of government now, and from the rise of global-scaled ICT corporations to become key management exemplars for officials. Second, we look at the chequered history of political leaders' interventions to speed up digital change, showing that in the period 2015–19 Australia witnessed both the initial power and later limits of such involvement. Finally, we consider Australia's recent experience with big data/artificial intelligence (BDAI), a key area of technological change for public service officials, but one that in a liberal democracy can also easily spark public resistance to their plans."
Australian and People's Republic of China government conceptions of the international order.,"van Nieuwenhuizen, Simone",Australian Journal of International Affairs,Taylor & Francis Ltd,INTERNATIONAL cooperation; INTERNATIONAL law; HUMAN rights; WORLD Trade Organization; AUSTRALIA-China relations,Australia-China relations; foreign policy analysis; International order; rules-based order,"Through qualitative comparative analysis of policy documents and official statements over the last 10 years (2008–2018), this paper examines Australian and PRC government conceptions of the international order and the associated policy implications. Their understandings of the international order are informed by their self-defined national role conceptions and perceptions of other states, and are manifested in discussions of institutional reform, international law and human rights. Australia's self-conception as a middle power informs its emphasis on maintenance and US leadership of the existing order, while the PRC's self-conceptions as both a developing and established power enable it to frame itself as either an upholder or reformer of the order. Both governments highlight the 'rules-based' mechanisms of the WTO, and are more likely to agree on trade and economic issues than on other matters. Their responses to the 2016 South China Sea arbitration tribunal decision and discussions of the role of human rights in the international order suggest less agreement is likely on international law and human rights norms. While Australia considers the PRC a potential challenger to the existing order, Australia does not feature in PRC discussions of international order, suggesting its limited ability to affect PRC foreign policy decisions."
Australia's use of international education as public diplomacy in China: foreign policy or domestic agenda?,"McConachie, Bradley",Australian Journal of International Affairs,Taylor & Francis Ltd,GLOBAL studies; INTERNATIONAL relations; GOVERNMENT aid; CHINA; AUSTRALIA-China relations,Australia; China; foreign policy; international education; Public diplomacy; scholarships,"This research utilises expert interviews to investigate why the Australian Government funds the New Colombo Plan (NCP) and the Australian Studies Centres (ASCs) as public diplomacy in China. The ASCs have grown with no increase in funding, however, the academics view themselves as facilitators of Australian Studies not an arm of public diplomacy, despite their work contributing toward positive Australia-China relations. Evaluating the efficacy of the ASC's contribution to public diplomacy is fraught with risk. Some suggest that political activism may backfire when governments explicitly outline their soft power strategies. As the NCP has no longitudinal measurements, this research is an initial review of short-term achievements. However, the external survey with 16% return rate, and just over 50% response rate indicating an intention to act as ambassadors for the program, requires review by the funding department. The opportunity for the Government to send a positive message to China and the strong people-to-people networks fostered by the two programs' participants have the potential to influence the nexus between Australian foreign policy, international education as public diplomacy and public engagement with foreign policy. This alone, should be sufficient to justify continued funding, or in the case of the ASCs, increased funding."

Using two scenario-based survey experiments in China, one hypothetical and one that selectively reminds respondents of recent events, we assess how government statements and propaganda impact Chinese citizens' approval of their government's performance in its territorial and maritime disputes. We find evidence that citizens disapprove more of inaction after explicit threats to use force, suggesting that leaders can face public opinion costs akin to audience costs in an authoritarian setting. However, we also find evidence that citizens approve of bluster—vague and ultimately empty threats—suggesting that talking tough can provide benefits, even in the absence of tough action. In addition, narratives that invoke future success to justify present restraint increase approval, along with frames that emphasize a shared history of injustice at the hands of foreign powers."
Authoritarian Resilience Revisited: Joseph Fewsmith with Response from Andrew J.

But it did not happen. In 2003, Andrew Nathan offered an explanation. The factionalism of the past was weakening in the face of growing professionalism and functional specialization. Political succession was increasingly bound by widely accepted norms, and the regime, though still authoritarian, was the beneficiary of feedback mechanisms that allowed a degree of political participation and provided information on contentious issues. In short, institutions were being created that strengthened the regime and extended its longevity."
"Authoritarian responsiveness: Online consultation with ""issue publics"" in China.","Kornreich, Yoel",Governance,Wiley-Blackwell,FEDERAL government; AUTHORITARIANISM; POLICY sciences; DECISION making in government policy; PUBLIC opinion; CHINA -- Politics & government; CHINA,,"In recent years, public consultation has become a standard feature of policymaking in authoritarian regimes. While previous studies found evidence of government responsiveness to citizens' demands, they did not measure responsiveness in terms of real policy change. This article presents the first systematic analysis of Chinese central government policy responsiveness to consultative input. In 2008, the Chinese government unveiled a blueprint for health‐care reform, inviting the public to post their opinions online. Having collected 27,899 online comments, the government subsequently published a revised draft. This article analyzes a random sample of 2% of this corpus of comments, assessing the effect of comments on revisions while controlling for both media content and bureaucratic preferences. The findings demonstrate that public comments have an impact upon policy revisions and suggest that the Chinese government is more responsive to street‐level implementers than to other social groups."

Pakistan's largest province in terms of landmass it enjoys an important geostrategic position because of its proximity with the Middle East, Central Asia, South Asia and the Indian Ocean. With the recent developments ahead in sight of the CPEC the major world powers are shifting their focus to Gwadar, which is the central piece of the whole CPEC and is located close to the Strait of Hormuz through which 20% of total global oil production passes through. The likely CPEC network of roads and rails will provide China with an easy and much shorter trade route to the markets of Europe, Gulf and Africa. Given the significance of Gwadar and Balochistan province several analysts and researchers have questioned about the welfare of the locals residing in the region. The basic aim of this paper is to look at how the CPEC and its projects are going to impact the lives of the local population, particularly the Baloch. In order to lead CPEC projects to their successful completion, it is imperative to take in account the needs and grievances of the local people; who unless have their objections addressed can cause trouble. The basic thing is to adopt the policy of inclusivity by taking the local stakeholders (the politicians, the fishermen, the nationalists and the young unemployed youth) on board and by making the local people skillfully capable through vocational trainings thus opening the array of opportunities that CPEC shall bring to the region. The paper is qualitative in nature and has employed primary and secondary sources of data collection using literature review, semi-structured interviews and focus group discussions as tools for data analysis."

Based on data from the 2012 Nationwide Survey of Private Enterprises in China, it finds that: (i) politically connected firms were more likely to have access to commercial bank loans; (ii) the mechanism for this better access might be that, on the one hand, political connection was used by private firms as a tool to overcome discrimination and/or information asymmetry in the loan market; on the other hand, political connection was seen by banks as a signal of creditworthiness; and (iii) the importance of political connection seems to lie in the connection to the power to govern rather than the mere opportunity to influence policy."

With reference to these international principles and standards, China has also launched a regulation-guided reform to promote the modernisation of bankers' remuneration. This article provides the first empirical analysis of the regulation and practice of bankers' remuneration and incentives in China's state-owned commercial banks (SOCBs). The empirical evidence shows that the regulation has not been effectively implemented. Instead, the traditional politicised and administrative approach, which prioritises political incentives over market-oriented remuneration, remains predominant."

Although censorship in China silences collective expression, social media empower Chinese sexual minorities to promote information publicity and increase public visibility. Moreover, by looking at the case of Qiu Bai, a lesbian college student who sued the Ministry of Education for its maladministration on homophobic textbooks in a social media environment, it indicates how LGBT activists use social media to enlighten the public during the process of fighting for their equal rights within the legal framework and more broadly, how the Internet influences the state-society relations in a traditionally sensitive issue area."

In early June, they declared that the Russian-Chinese strategic partnership relationship entered a ""new age,"" while celebrating the 70th anniversary of diplomatic relations. Barely a week later, Putin and Xi attended the 19th SCO Summit in Bishkek. From there, they joined fifth Interaction and Confidence-Building Measures in Asia (CICA) Summit in Dushanbe. At the end of June, they were part of the G20 Summit in Osaka, where they joined in a mini Russia-India-China (RIC) gathering with Indian PM Narendra Modi before meeting separately with US President Donald Trump. There was also a significant upgrade in joint activity by the militaries. It began with the maritime stage of the annual Joint Sea naval drill in the Yellow Sea in early May and ended with China's participation in Russia's Center-2019 exercises on Sept. 16-21. In between, Russian and Chinese bombers conducted the first-ever joint patrol over the Sea of Japan and the East China Sea. Meanwhile, Chinese analysts actively deliberated the nature, scale, depth and limits of China's ""best-ever"" relationship with Russia.

ASEAN and Southeast Asian claimants adhered to Beijing's demands to avoid reference to the 2016 UNCLOS tribunal ruling against China's South China Sea claims and to handle disputes through negotiations without outside interference. Routine complaints about more frequent US freedom of navigation exercises and other US and allied military operations in the South China Sea came from lower-level ministry spokespersons.

Prior to 2013, many of the BRI's objectives and strategies were already at work in Africa, and particularly in socioeconomically poor, landlocked countries that badly need infrastructure and connectivity. It also shows that China has been ready to invest in projects that are not necessarily profitable in the short term to consolidate its economic and diplomatic presence in the targeted country as well as to help its large state firms growing and internationalizing. It then demonstrates that although Niger did not belong in the initial group of countries targeted by the BRI, this initiative has contributed to deepening China's economic and political influence in Niger, particularly to the detriment of France. Finally, this article highlights that both in Africa, particularly in the Sahel region, and in the BRI countries, China is facing emerging security challenges, continuing to mainly rely on others to overcome them."

The positions taken by both Japan and India, together and singly, in relation to BRI as well as the interrelationship of policy, politics, and institutions at the global level are discussed. The discussion also explores how Japan supplements its central alliance with the United States till the 1980s with other key relationships such as India and Australia in security and in its initiatives with India on Vision 25 and the Asia‐Africa Growth Corridor (AAGC). The discussion also explores the shift by India following its non‐alignment policy and its friendship treaty with the Soviet Union and with the end of the Cold War, on its renewed foreign policy of diplomacy and bilateralism and multilateralism with many countries and organizations. The challenges and opportunities of collaboration by Japan and India are discussed, together with the geo‐economic and geo‐political aspects of BRI for both countries in moving forward. Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) does not cover just Asia, Europe, and Africa. It is evolving and has been extended to Latin‐America and the Arctic.

The new international organization's officials in Paris and its representatives on the ground in China were thus forced to navigate a fractious and fluid set of national circumstances that would result in an ambiguous outcome in 1949, with regimes on the Chinese mainland and Taiwan both claiming to represent 'China'. Although the KMT-led Republic of China continued to claim membership in UNESCO until the 1970s, the international organization nevertheless continued to operate within the People's Republic of China (PRC) for a number of years. Exploring the relationship between the issue of Chinese representation in UNESCO and the organization's on-the-ground presence from the mid-1940s through to the early 1950s, this article argues that domestic and international factors were inescapably intertwined in shaping the trajectory of Chinese relations with international organizations during this period. While CCP officials demonstrated a mixture of ideology and pragmatism, similar to their handling of foreign entities and groups present in the PRC after its founding, engagement with UNESCO was significantly shaped by the complexity and depth of the KMT's engagement with the international organization from its inception onwards. The CCP's relations with UNESCO underscore the extent to which the emerging Cold War—and China's place within it—was ultimately characterized by complexity and contingency."

Economic reforms since the late-1970s, however, have led to increased opportunities for rural migrants in urban labor markets. But how are rural migrants being incorporated into urban employment? Drawing on Tilly's relational inequality perspective, this article examines the relationship between hukou and job quality—paying particular attention to (1) nonstandard employment and (2) ownership sector. Compared to urban hukou workers, we find that rural hukou holders are more likely to be sorted into jobs with nonstandard employment relations—jobs with fewer benefits. Hence, a significant portion of the urban-rural gap in job quality is attributed to categorically linked sorting into nonstandard employment net of human capital. Further analyses reveal significant differences between sectors. These results highlight the durable and enduring nature of hukou as a significant basis of stratification in contemporary urban China."

Through a comparative analysis of the Sino-Spanish trade with that of other smaller powers in China, this article shows both the diversity of colonial formations in China and the existence of colonial relations that, although peripheral and complementary, pose a doubt on the adequacy, not only of the colonizer/colonized dichotomy, but also of the representation of colonialism in China."

It finds that some aspects of the Old Public Administration (OPA) have been combined with NPM and post-NPM features in a layering process, resulting in new hybrid organizational forms and value orientations. In particular, the analysis shows that China's post-NPM-oriented reforms have focused on positive coordination in the sense of super-ministries and networks on the one hand and value-based governance with a service orientation on the other hand."
Beyond the 'Hidden Agricultural Revolution' and 'China's Overseas Land Investment': Main Trends in China's Agriculture and Food Sector.,"Zhang, Jin",Journal of Contemporary China,Taylor & Francis Ltd,"NEOLITHIC revolution; INVESTMENTS; AGRICULTURAL industries -- China; AGRICULTURAL productivity -- China; LABOR costs; HUANG, Philip",,"This article has three parts. The first part discusses the multiple agricultural production modalities that currently can be observed in China. By analyzing the complexity of the existing modalities, it will be shown that agricultural production in China still relies strongly on peasant farming. The second part explains that the domestic agrarian change influences China's relation with the global food market. This implies that China's overseas agricultural investment and the domestic agrarian situation should be studied together instead of being separated from each other. The third part focuses on the internal changes of agricultural production in China. Based on the thesis of 'hidden agricultural revolution' as elaborated by Philip Huang, it is argued that dietary transition indeed plays a critical role in the restructuring of the agricultural production in China. But this is only an exogenous driving force. The endogenous drivers of structural change in agricultural production are the rapid increase in land rent and labor costs in China. Agricultural structural change is a process of mutual interaction between the exogenous conditions and endogenous conditions."
Beyond the Left-Right Spectrum: A Typological Analysis of Ideologues in China's Weibo Space.,"Huang, Ronggui; Gui, Yong; Sun, Xiaoyi",Journal of Contemporary China,Taylor & Francis Ltd,POLITICAL doctrines; LIBERALS; ECONOMIC liberty; CENSORSHIP; INFORMATION sharing; PUBLIC sphere; CHINA,,"This study aims to investigate Weibo users' political ideologies in China. It argues that a left-right spectrum cannot adequately depict the ideological landscape, and proposes a typological framework to guide the analysis of competing ideologies. Based on a sample of 3440 Weibo users, this article uses latent class model to identify sub-types of ideologues. It discerns five ideological groups, namely Maoists, regime defenders, full-fledged liberals, economic liberals, and political liberals, as well as one politically silent group. The results show that liberal leaning Weibo users are not a homogeneous group, and should not be holistically conceived as regime challengers in opposition to regime defenders. To a certain degree, economic liberals are more similar to regime defenders than Maoists, and this can be better understood from a typological perspective than a spectrum perspective. This article concludes with a discussion on the political implications of the findings."

An exploratory text analysis of more than 370,000 online comments on the downfall of the first 100 big tigers, from 2012 to 2015, reveals that public support for the top national leader who initiated the anticorruption campaign significantly exceeded that afforded to anticorruption agencies and institutions. Further regression analyses show that support for the leaders with respect to intuitions increased with the tigers' party ranking. Findings suggest that while campaign‐style enforcement can reinforce the central authority and magnify support for individual leaders, it may also marginalize the role of legal institutions crucial to long‐term corruption control."

This article focuses on how China uses OFDI as a tool of economic statecraft, and how the fact that OFDI is a tool of economic statecraft influences the reception of Chinese investment in European host countries. Proceeding through case studies of the high profile KUKA and Aixtron cases, it analyzes the conditions in the host country under which economic statecraft facilitates or complicates the completion of an acquisition, and demonstrates the challenges that Chinese firms are facing when investing in the EU due to their inseparable or suspected connections with the Chinese party-state. It finds that besides political or private party and stakeholder support, the sector and the lack of reciprocity, there is a critical role for legal frameworks, which is reflected in various calls for legal bases and screening mechanisms to block state-backed moves on strategic industries."

Around the early twentieth century, some bourgeois members of overseas Chinese in Hong Kong, Taiwan, and South Seas mobilised Confucianism as an ethno‐symbol. The latter helped the overseas Chinese bourgeoisie to counter the quest for greater secularisation and to confront the surge of anti‐imperialist movements. The implications of this research include to recentre the role of overseas Chinese in China's modern transformation; to decentre the May Fourth agendas in the understanding of overseas Chinese nationalism; and to situate overseas Chinese nationalism in an extraterritorial space, which includes the Confucian zone created in the dialogical connections between Confucian intellectual elites (such as Zheng Xiaoxu and Chen Huanzhang) and overseas Chinese bourgeois networks that converged in Hong Kong and spread transnationally."

After nearly two decades of debt-financed infrastructure development, Beijing's exposure to African debt is reaching disquieting proportions with an estimated US$132 billion owed to China in 2016. Managing this new role as Africa's creditor poses uncomfortable questions for creditor and debtor alike. Concurrently, the quiet surge of Chinese investment in manufacturing in Africa is transforming local economies in ways that are beginning to alter the continent's position within the global economy. Finally, the proliferation of Chinese businesses and migrants across Africa is inspiring greater Chinese involvement in UN peacekeeping and private security initiatives. This article examines how these structural changes are challenging core practices and principles which guided China–Africa relations in its formative decades. For instance, under the banner of an alternative to western policies China promoted the absence of conditionalities attached to its concessional loans and grants. Equally, promotion of industrialization of African economies marks a key shift away from China's resource-centric engagement with the continent. And, in the case of security, Beijing's commitment to avoid intervention in domestic affairs is being set aside with implications for its principles, and ultimately status, in Africa."

This article tests the power of such arguments by examining the impact of Chinese outward FDI (OFDI) in Brazil, Brazil's trade with China, and Chinese loans to Brazil on Brazil's China policy. It finds that broad and deep economic ties indeed have pushed Brazil in the direction of China. However, the magnitude of such changes has been limited. The reasons for bounded change include differing interests and positions at the system and state-levels. Also relevant are domestic political factors such as pressures from special interest groups in Brazil. Finally, the political power of Brazilian leaders plays a role in bounding the positive political effects expected to flow from Brazil's deep economic interconnections with China. It must be noted that many putatively China-friendly Brazilian policies had roots long before Brazil's economic ties with China exploded. This article calls into question the presumption that significant economic links with China and/or the prospect of such automatically will produce the China-favorable political policies some expect."

Despite its importance, there is a dearth of research on public opinion about British foreign policy towards other major players in the international system, such as emerging powers like China. We have addressed this knowledge gap by conducting a public opinion survey in the UK after the Brexit referendum. Our research findings indicate that the British public at large finds China's rise disconcerting, but is also pragmatic in its understanding of how the ensuing bilateral relations should be managed. More importantly, our results show that views on China are clearly split between the two opposing Brexit identities. Those who subscribe strongly to the Leave identity, measured by their aversion to the EU and antipathy towards immigration, are also more likely to hold negative perceptions of Chinese global leadership and be more suspicious of China as a military threat. In contrast, those who espouse a Remain identity—that is, believe that Britain would be better served within the EU and with more immigrants—are more likely to prefer closer engagement with China and to have a more positive outlook overall on China's place within the global community."

First, people value the renqing ethic more than law, making it hard to judge whether a relation has ""improper inducements."" Second, some interaction rituals used in bribery guanxi are a type of moral performance, undertaken to justify immoral practice - this mixes together guanxi practice with bribery. Third, some of the ""ganqing"" (affection) and esteem expressed in bribery guanxi results from this moral performance, rather than from genuine affection and esteem. Fourth, some people try to embody their relationship as an enduring guanxi, rather than one-off bribery, which exacerbates the difficulty in distinguishing guanxi from bribery. Because of the moralizing culture and the custom of mixing together renqinq and bribery, it can be difficult to distinguish bribery from guanxi by attempting to judge whether an action is purely based on esteem or coercion, on an enduring relationship or a one-off exchange, on improper inducement or proper conduct, or other such formal distinctions."

In fact, even though they are not considered to be as accountable as western countries in many areas, their leading commitment to global issues such as climate change could provide an important solution to strengthening their weak 'soft power'. By working together to instigate global change, and taking advantage of Western 'decline', can the BRICS play a decisive role in shaping global governance?"

The fracturing of the Asian identity has been evident in the political discourses on the 'war on terror' and community cohesion, with both defining British Muslims through their religious identity, as opposed to their Asian identity, an identity for which inter Asian commonality existed. This article draws on research that was conducted on British Muslims' perceptions of social policy since the 1980s and explores the extent to which changes in governmental policies have impacted British Muslims' perceptions of commonality with non-British Muslims. The article demonstrates how the 'war on terror' and community cohesion are negatively impacting social cohesion through making British Muslims feel isolated and marginalised in society. The implications of the findings are discussed in relation to the radicalisation of British Muslims and the growing influence of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS)."

The officers did not stop at the technical and tactical aspects of the war but urged changes in the state and in society. Specifically, they argued that the creation of a “total mobilization state,” namely, the militarization of society and expansion of the state’s responsibility in controlling the economy and the lives of the people, was the means to prepare for the inevitable conflict against the potential aggressors, Japan and the Soviet Union. However, before many steps were taken to build such a state, the Fengtian leadership made a series of strategic mistakes that left Manchuria almost defenseless against the Japanese invasion of September 1931."

This paper extends the view that the root cause of these issues is the lack of regional public goods (RPGs) on the Korean Peninsula, and its insufficiency results from three major conflicts in the politico-economic situation of the Peninsula. In order to resolve the issues and maintain lasting peace, three specific aspects, i.e., in diplomacy, security and economy, are to be addressed in carrying out the long-term mission of supplying RPGs to the Peninsula. For effective operation and comprehensive management of the RPGs provision, an integration platform with powerful commitments is called for, i.e., ""Association of Trans-Korean Peninsula Nations"" (ATKPN) co-established by China, the United States, and the two Koreas. Apart from the dilemma commonly identified in the delivery of RPGs, the ATKPN also faces dilemmas specifically from the Northeast Asian order. To overcome the ATKPN's obstacles, concerted efforts are needed to promote the institutionalization of Sino-U.S. ""new type of great power relations,"" to transform the function of the alliance system, and to cultivate the awareness of ""common external threats."""

Based on the fieldwork in China, this research examines the dynamics of environmental legal mobilization and identifies the support structure that mobilizes legal actions. This article finds that three main frames will impact the support structure in a way that social groups need to construct a consensus with state authorities: (1) assisting the government; (2) advocating policy change and promoting legal reforms; and (3) resolving local environmental problems. This research sheds new light on legal mobilization theory and argues that China's legal reform will open new pathways for robust social participation and signify a more formal rule of law."

It uses research on climate change mitigation in China and India to explore how government agencies seek to overcome challenges of limited capacity and competing priorities by bundling climate change together with more immediate priorities and thereby developing a coalition with an interest in achieving these objectives. The article is based on interviews conducted in China and India, as well as analysis of themes covered in the growing body of literature on the domestic politics of climate change mitigation. In both countries we found that pragmatic approaches leveraging what already exists made significant progress in putting energy efficiency on the agenda, strengthening institutional presence (in India) and delivering improvements in energy efficiency (in China). Yet, we also found that the use of these tactics had significant limitations. While there was probably no other way that the policy space given to climate change mitigation could have increased so rapidly, there are significant side effects that arise as a result of the traction gained by these initial policy approaches. While bundling raised the profile of energy efficiency, it also created perverse incentives that highlight the need to consider the long‐term effect on the interests, capacity and sustainability of informal coalitions. We highlight the need to take account of both the short‐ and long‐term effects of thinking and working politically, and the challenges of doing so when the outcomes are unpredictable and inherently difficult to assess."

In 1954, Burma began to move closer to China in order to balance the Western influence in the country. The diplomatic balancing skills of Burmese leaders were reflected in Burma's early postcolonial diplomacy and constitute a substantial core dimension of the Burmese foreign policy tradition. Between 1998 and 2010 Burma was heavily reliant on China in the face of Western sanctions and its relative isolation; China's influence thus increased sharply in that country. The pattern of China-Burma-US triangular relations that was restructured in the early 1950s reappeared in the twenty-first century. Beginning in 2011, Nay Pyi Taw's policy reflected a determination to weaken China's growing influence and rebalance Burmese relations with Washington and Beijing. However, this Burmese rebalancing was overinterpreted by the media as Nay Pyi Taw's shift into the American orbit. Both Thein Sein and Aung San Suu Kyi have attempted to steer Burma's foreign policy back to its traditional neutralist and nonaligned track."

The growing power and influence of emerging economies has resulted in increased scholarly interest in China on studying the domestic political commitments to corporate social responsibility strategies (CSR), and their potential contribution to promoting the country's ambitious Belt and Road Initiative and thereby achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This article explores the factors that influence CSR strategies and performance and examines whether we are witnessing the emergence of a new form of social responsibility among Chinese businesses that prioritizes sustainable development. In order to better understand how CSR strategies in China are being potentially reshaped and realigned with the SDGs, we examined the CSR reports and practices of selected Chinese companies both before and after the adoption of the SDGs at the United Nations in 2015. By focusing on the CSR-SDG linkages in China, our study contributes to a better understanding of state advocacy aimed at influencing corporate behavior on sustainable development."
Business as usual? Economic responses to political tensions between China and Japan.,"Li, Xiaojun; Liu, Adam Y",International Relations of the Asia-Pacific,Oxford University Press / USA,POLITICS & economics; GOVERNMENT ownership; EXPORTS; INTERNATIONAL relations; SENKAKU Islands; CHINA-Japan relations,,"What is the relationship between political tensions and economic relations? In this study, we explore this question by examining how Japan's nationalization of the Diaoyu/Senkaku Islands, a territory much disputed with China, has affected bilateral trade between the world's second and third largest economies. Using monthly data, we find that the nationalization imbroglio has negatively affected the amount of goods Japan exports to China, with the effect being most pronounced for highly salient and visible products such as automobiles and cameras; these experienced immediate and dramatic drops lasting up to 12 months. In contrast, raw materials and intermediate goods were not affected at all; some even experienced increased exports. These findings suggest that consumer and corporate responses to political tensions may follow different logics. For consumers, certain political tensions, especially those involving enduring territorial disputes, could override entrenched economic interests and preferences, at least in the short term. In these instances, it will no longer be business as usual."

Business Lobbying within the Party-State: Embedding Lobbying and Political Co-optation in China.,"Huang, Dongya; Chen, Minglu",China Journal,University of Chicago Press,COOPTATION; LOBBYING; AUTHORITARIANISM; BUSINESSPEOPLE; TRADE associations,,"Most existing scholarship regards private businesspeople in China as allies of the party-state, without considering how the private sector's policy influence is possible in an authoritarian state where the political elites dominate the policy-making process. Based on the large number of successful proposals that the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce (ACFIC) has submitted to the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, this study reveals the rising policy influence of private businesspeople in the past decade. It finds that their influence on government policy is not realized simply through collusion or informal ties with local governments at the stage of policy implementation. Instead, they now can voice their interests and exert influence as a group in national policy making at the central level through formal institutional channels. In recent years the influence of business associations affiliated with the ACFIC has been increasing, mainly due to institutional changes at the national level that encompass their input. This entails political co-optation that helps empower the private sector to exert influence on policy, rendering it unnecessary for the business community to challenge the political system from the bottom up."

As with the constant reference to the originally charted course for recalibrating direction when piloting a huge ship, China's reform and opening-up also requires constant comparison with its original target destination to recalibrate its direction moving forward. This article combines Xi Jinping thought on socialism with Chinese characteristics for a new era with the new practice of comprehensively deepening the reform since the 18th CPC National Congress in 2012, and presents a systematic analysis and elaboration for the direction calibration of the reform and opening-up with their conditions in the new era from six aspects, i.e., the reform and opening-up and its direction and methodology, its starting and ending points, its core issues, its foothold, its independence, Party conduct and social atmosphere. This article not only points out that this calibration amounts to the rectification and remedy of past deficiencies, but also notes further measures to be taken in response to changes of the actual situation and new developments."

However, African opinions of China – in particular those of ordinary people – are understudied, and existing evidence suggests African viewpoints on China are highly varied and polarized. On the one hand, China's growing economic linkages are welcomed by Africans as an important alternative to traditional partners, and a vital source of funding for development needs. On the other hand, Africans see China as a source of poor-quality products and an exploitative threat to local markets. How can scholars understand these polarized opinions on China? Using data from the Afrobarometer Round 6 survey (2016), this article aims to untangle African perceptions of Chinese economic engagement through unpacking the distinctive effects of China's three tools of economic statecraft: trade, foreign direct investment, and aid. Analyses of Chinese influence frequently package these three modes of engagement together, but in practice they have very different consequences for China's soft power. Negative perceptions of China among African citizens are primarily associated with trade-related issues. China's investment and aid, on the other hand, generally make a positive contribution to Chinese soft power in Africa. By highlighting the contrasting effects of different instruments of economic engagement, this analysis contributes insight into Sino-African relations and China's wider economic diplomacy."
Can North Korea Follow China's Path? A Comparative Study of the Nexus Between National Security and Economic Reforms.,"Lee, Inyeop",Pacific Focus,Wiley-Blackwell,NATIONAL security; ECONOMIC reform; ECONOMIC development; NORTH Korea; NORMALIZATION (Sociology),China; economic reform; national security; North Korea,"Why has North Korea been unable to implement serious economic reforms like those of China? By tracing the process of economic reform in China, this paper argues that the improvement of national security, especially as a result of diplomatic normalization with the United States, was an essential precondition for successful economic reform and growth. It reduced the fear of an open‐door policy and eased domestic control as well as reallocation of resources from the military to economic development. Furthermore, diplomatic normalization with the United States lifted economic sanctions, and allowed access to global markets, foreign direct investments, and membership in major international economic organizations. However, North Korea has technically been at war with the United States for the last 66 years. Therefore, it maintains very tight control of its population and spends a substantial portion of its GDP on the military. It has also been under severe economic sanctions and does not have access to the global economy. The possibility of any meaningful economic reforms in North Korea will depend on its success in improving national security by resolving the nuclear issue and normalizing diplomatic relations with the United States."
"Can the dual identity of policy entrepreneur and policy implementer promote successful policy adoption? Vertical greening policymaking in Shanghai, China.","Lu, Hongmei; Mayer, Audrey L.; Wellstead, Adam M.; Zhou, Shan",Journal of Asian Public Policy,Taylor & Francis Ltd,,China; dual role; Policy entrepreneur; policy implementer; Shanghai; vertical greening policy,"Both policy entrepreneur and policy implementer play critical roles in the policy process. Little attention has been devoted to how the identity overlap may influence policy change. This paper addresses this gap using a case-study approach and explores the vertical-greening policymaking in Shanghai (1992–2016), China. Three conclusions are advanced. The identity of policy implementer prompts entrepreneurial tactics to remove the implementation barriers. The discrepancy in perception of the policy-goal ambiguity between the policy implementer and policymaker may compromise policy adoption. The dual identity does not prevent the policy entrepreneur from accepting compromises in order to have the policy passed."
Can the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership minimise the harm from the United States–China trade war?,"Mahadevan, Renuka; Nugroho, Anda",World Economy,Wiley-Blackwell,INTERNATIONAL trade disputes; TRADE blocs; TARIFF; CHINA; UNITED States; SCHEDULING,Asia mega trade bloc; computable general equilibrium; trade war,"Using ex post tariff schedules for the first time, it was found that the global gains provided by the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) are not enough to overcome the negative impacts of the United States–China trade dispute. While trade tensions cause China's welfare loss to be more than twice as large as the United States, they provide some trade diversion to RCEP members. But of concern is if India successfully delays the conclusion of the RCEP even by a year, there will be a global loss of US$17.7 billion. The RCEP is also beneficial for the emerging economy of Vietnam and the high‐tariff‐imposing Korean economy. The results obtained here are, however, conservative as reduction in non‐tariff barriers and other positive spillover effects of trade liberalisation related to investment and productivity improvements due to competition or increased intra‐industry trade could not be accounted for."
Canada as a peninsula state: Conceptualizing the emerging geopolitical landscape in the 21st century.,"Kawasaki, Tsuyoshi",International Journal,Sage Publications Inc.,,a peninsula state; Canada; China; geopolitics; grand strategy; the Arctic,"An unprecedented geopolitical landscape, driven by the reduction of Arctic ice and the rise of China as ""a Polar power,"" is emerging. What does this mean for Canada, and how should Canada respond to it in a systematic and strategic manner? We need a coherent and holistic conceptual framework to answer these key policy questions. Yet, the current literatures do not offer us such a concept. In an attempt to fill the void, this article presents a vision that conceives of Canada as ""a peninsula state"" exposed to great power politics in its vicinity, involving China as a rising power as well as the United States and Russia as resident powers. Furthermore, it argues that Canada should be prepared for three kinds of strategic dynamics as it enters the game of great power politics: theatre-linkage tactics and wedge-driving tactics vis-à-vis China and Russia, as well as quasi-alliance dilemma with the United States. Moreover, in order for Canada to cope with this complex international environment effectively, this article calls for creating a cabinet-level unit to coordinate various federal bureaucracies' foreign and security policies."

Canadian media coverage is thought to negatively bias public opinion and thereby constrain foreign policy choices available to policymakers. Scholars of Canada-Japan relations worry that decreasing media attention could have longer term effects on bilateral ties. Through an analysis of over 30,000 articles appearing in three major Canadian news publications over a 15-year time span (2000-2015), we identify how news about these countries is framed to the Canadian public and how these frames change over time. Our central finding is that the Canadian media experienced a ""twenty-first century discovery of China"" in 2004-2005. The volume of coverage of Chinese economic news spiked, while coverage of political rights declined, portraying China as a leader in the global economy and therefore a viable economic partner. Yet we find that media coverage is only loosely tied to public opinion. Counterintuitively, Canadian attitudes toward China have become more negative with increased positive news coverage, while declining coverage of Japan is correlated with increasingly positive views of the country."
"Canteens and the Politics of Working-class Diets in Industrial China, 1920–37.","LEE, SEUNG-JOON",Modern Asian Studies,Cambridge University Press,INDUSTRIAL workers; LABOR supply; EMPLOYEE food service; FOOD prices; LABOR activists; INDUSTRIAL productivity,,"This article explores how workers' diets and meal services at factory canteens became the nucleus of labour politics in Republican Shanghai, China's industrial heartland. At the heart of Chinese labour politics was a demand for the improvement of workers' diets, particularly for adequate meal service, which was to be provided by management at a reasonable price—if not for free—at the workplace. The purpose of this article is not only to draw attention to a lacuna in Chinese labour history, but also to shed new light on the agency of workers in their labour disputes from the perspective of food history. No other issue provided a better opportunity to unite workers, labour activists, and so-called scabs than the issue of food. In the wake of labour disputes, industrialists changed their perception of the relation between industrial health and work efficiency. With the promotion of factory canteens, the Guomidang Nationalists also began to exert unsparing efforts to garner the growing political potential of the labour force. Therefore, factory canteens evolved into a contested space in which workers, management, and the state offered different visions of workers' diets and industrial productivity."
"Caring for the People: Chen Yun and the Making of Chinese Communist Urban Policy in Shenyang, 1948.","Solieri, Flavia",American Journal of Chinese Studies,American Journal of Chinese Studies,"CIVIL war; COMMUNISM; COMMUNIST parties; SHENYANG (Liaoning Sheng, China); INDUSTRIAL productivity",1948; Chen Yun; Chinese Communist Party; city takeover; countryside and cities; Shenyang; united front; urban policy,"On November 2, 1948, Chinese Communist troops, mostly of peasant origin, conquered Shenyang. The occupation of Shenyang, completing Communist control of former Manchuria, was a turning point in their civil war with the Nationalist Party government of Chiang Kaishek, even as the management of that metropolis presented them with an unprecedented challenge. Shenyang was a large industrial city, with almost one million inhabitants. A quick recovery, particularly of its heavy-industrial production, was crucial for both the continued prosecution of the war and future reconstruction. With the appointment of Chen Yun as the city’s top authority, the Communists implemented a strictly militarized and highly centralized pattern of city takeover and administration. The successful takeover marked a dramatic improvement vis-à-vis past experiences and attained an exemplary status within the Communist Party’s new urban political orientation. This article investigates to what extent, and under what conditions, were the particular needs and feelings of Shenyang’s inhabitants (including their concerns about economic well-being and their anxieties about public order and personal security) taken into consideration. A careful reading of Chinese primary sources, as well as of American declassified intelligence reports, provides very telling, and even surprising, insights into Chen Yun’s approach, including his attention not only to human welfare but even to the states of mind of the city-dwelling population, and how the policies he developed were also aligned with broader Communist political aims."
"Carsun Chang on Democratic Socialism: Liberalism, Social Democracy, and German Idealism.",Lifang Peng,American Journal of Chinese Studies,American Journal of Chinese Studies,"DEMOCRATIC socialism; LIBERALISM; SOCIAL democracy; GERMAN idealism; CHANG, Carsun",Carsun Chang; democratic socialism; ideological morphology; New Liberalism,"Contrary to the historiography of the Chinese Communists, socialism in modern China was not dominated by Marxism. There were heated intellectual debates over socialism in relation to the problems of modern China. In these debates many Chinese liberals disagreed with Marxists and proposed alternative interpretations of socialism. This article focuses on Carsun Chang's distinctive theory of ""democratic socialism,"" which was neither Marxian socialism nor pure social democracy. I argue that Chang's democratic socialism combined some core concepts of liberalism, German idealism, and some socialist elements, which bore a strong resemblance to the ""liberal socialism"" proposed by the British thinker Leonard T. Hobhouse. Therefore the mainstream view that Chang was an exemplar of social democracy is too narrow to describe the complexity of his thought. Chang's discourse on socialism represents a distinctive, though often ignored, liberal tradition in Republican China, which might be best described as a form of New Liberalism."
"Cautious Bully: Reputation, Resolve, and Beijing's Use of Coercion in the South China Sea.","Zhang, Ketian",International Security,MIT Press,BOUNDARY disputes; ECONOMIC sanctions; NATIONAL security; DECISION making; SOUTH China Sea; MARITIME boundaries; CHINA -- Foreign relations,,"Since 1990, China has used coercion in its maritime territorial disputes in the South China Sea, despite adverse implications for its image. China is curiously selective in its timing, targets, and tools of coercion: China rarely employs military coercion, and it does not coerce all countries that pose similar threats. An examination of newly available primary documents and hundreds of hours of interviews with Chinese officials to trace the decisionmaking processes behind China's use and nonuse of coercion reveals a new theory of when, why, and how China employs coercion against other states, especially in the South China Sea. Contrary to conventional wisdom, the findings show that China is a cautious bully that does not use coercion frequently. In addition, when China becomes stronger, it tends to use military coercion less often, choosing instead nonmilitary tools. Moreover, concerns with its reputation for resolve and with economic cost are critical elements of Chinese decisionmaking regarding the costs and benefits of coercing its neighbors. China often coerces one target to deter others—""killing the chicken to scare the monkey."" These findings have important implications for how scholars understand states' coercive strategies and the future of Chinese behavior in the region and beyond."

The emergence of the region as an energy-producing center in the latest geological survey and endowment of massive quantities of oil and gas has undoubtedly invited global competition, which led to a struggle for resources between the U.S., China, Europe, and others. India, a country which, like China, consumes the most energy, has also been seeking for regional opportunities to meet its energy needs. In addition, Central Asia is a viable option both from the point of view of supply security and cost benefit analysis, as it provides an alternative to the hostile and unstable Middle East and its hydrocarbons are of high quality, with the producing countries consuming minimum amounts. In light of these circumstances, the article attempts to understand India's important energy quest in the region and examines how Central Asian energy is relevant to India's energy security concerns. It employs comparative analysis of the energy potential of the Central Asian countries and adheres to the viewpoint that India is actively involved in oil politics of Central Asia. Meanwhile, it suggests that India should seriously consider establishing strong political ties with the countries of the region if it wishes to play the major role in the energy sectors of the region; India needs strategic thinking in this respect and must prioritize the region in its foreign policy doctrine. In the energy sector India needs concrete strategy in place, particularly in light of the tough competition with China in the long term. It has to make prompt and tough decisions if New Delhi is serious about the resource struggle in Central Asia."

We ask whether Moscow and Beijing's regional integrative strategies do not guide, but rather are led by, everyday interactions among Russian and Chinese actors, and local actors in Central Asia. Rising powers, as a derivative of 'Great Powers', are frequently portrayed as structurally comparable units that concentrate power in their executives, fetishise territorial sovereignty, recruit client states, contest regional hegemony and explicitly oppose the post-1945 international order. In contrast, we demonstrate that the centred discourse of Eurasian integration promoted by Russian and Chinese leaders is decentred by networks of business and political elites, especially with regard to capital accumulation. Adopting Homi K. Bhabha's notion of mimicry (subversion, hybridity) and J. C. Scott's conception of mētis (local knowledge, agency), and using examples of Russian and Chinese investments and infrastructure projects in Central Asia, we argue that in order to understand centring discourse we must look to decentring practices at the periphery; that is, rising power is produced through ongoing interactions between actors at the margins of the state's hegemonic reach."

We found that the single-hazard areas and the multi-hazard areas covered 43% and 26% of China's territory, respectively. Population grew faster in the hazard-prone areas than in the non-hazard areas. Built-up area expanded more rapidly in the areas prone to earthquakes and landslides. Cropland changed rapidly in many hazard-prone areas. The hazard-prone areas affected by floods featured the highest cropland loss rates, while the areas prone to earthquakes and landslides featured the highest cropland growth rates. We detected areas with significant exposure changes by using hot spot analysis. It was found that population and built-up land in the Pearl River Basin were increasingly exposed to storm surges, floods, and landslides. The Haihe River Basin and Huaihe River Basin also showed a consistent increase of population and built-up land exposure to droughts and earthquakes. These findings can provide a foundation for the design and implementation of protection and adaptation strategies to improve the resilience of Chinese society to natural hazards."

But how has the campaign to expand this unrecognised state's network of diplomatic contacts been conducted? Using a wealth of contemporary archival material made available by Wikileaks, combined with interviews with key players in the process, this article investigates efforts to secure recognition for Abkhazia in the post-Soviet space, Latin America and amongst the South Pacific microstates. Different regions presented particular challenges and produced variable outcomes, some of which are counter-intuitive. Despite Russia's pre-eminence in the former USSR and its impressive arsenal of inducements and threats, the Kremlin failed to secure a single recognition for Abkhazia from another post-Soviet UN member state, though not from want of asking. Distant Latin America, where internecine Caucasian conflicts mattered little but alliances with Russian and antipathy towards the US were strong, produced the early recognitions and some near misses. As veterans of the China-Taiwan dispute, the microstates of the South Pacific region included many veterans of earlier diplomatic tugs-ofwar. With sovereignty for sale, recognitions had a price and could potentially be reversed if these miniature states were presented with a better offer. A final recognition provided by Syria was in large part payback for Russia saving Bashir Al-Assad's regime from oblivion. With some recognitions dependent on personalities or regimes rather than enduring inter-state solidarity and others influenced by pecuniary considerations, all are vulnerable."
Children of Chinese Migrants in Spain: New Expressions of Dual Identities and Identities in Between.,"ROBLES-LLANA, Paloma",Journal of Identity & Migration Studies,Journal of Identity & Migration Studies,IMMIGRANTS; CULTURAL identity; SPAIN; CHINESE; EXPRESSION,children; Chinese migration; identity; Spain,"Migration scholars have consistently referred to the cultural identities of migrants and migrant children as constructed out of elements from both their host and heritage cultures. They have drawn on cultural dichotomies and described these identities as dual, bicultural, hyphenated or in-between. Through a case study of three children of Chinese migrants living in Spain, this article questions the accuracy of using these categories to describe the cultural identities of the participants. Results show that the expressions and manifestations of dual or in-between identities of the participants were grounded in a biographical intersectionality that resists categorization and that is much more complex and diverse than what previous literature on the topic has suggested."
Children's and adults' perceptions of child necessities in Hong Kong.,"Lau, Maggie K.W.; Gordon, David; Zhang, Mary F.; Bradshaw, Jonathan",Social Policy & Administration,Wiley-Blackwell,POVERTY; SOCIAL policy; POOR children; SOCIAL conditions of children; HONG Kong (China) -- Social conditions,child necessities; consensual deprivation; Hong Kong; poverty; socially perceived necessities,"There is growing interest in child poverty and well‐being in East Asia. However, empirical studies predominantly adopt ""expert‐led"" measures (such as adult‐derived child deprivation measures), which usually assume that parents or guardians provide reliable reports about all their children's needs and that the allocation of household resources is effectively equal across all members. Studies of child poverty from a child‐rights or child‐agency perspective are rare in East Asia. Using a consensual deprivation approach, this article examines the extent of agreement between children and adults about which child possessions and activities constitute necessities of life in Hong Kong. The data are drawn from the second wave of the Strategic Public Policy Research project—Trends and Implications of Poverty and Social Disadvantages in Hong Kong: A Multi‐disciplinary and Longitudinal Study. A total of 595 adults and 636 school‐aged children from the first wave of the study were reinterviewed and asked if they considered 16 possessions and activities as essential for children in contemporary Hong Kong. The results showed that adults were significantly more likely to believe that almost all material and social deprivation items were necessities compared with their children, even after controlling for individual‐level factors (i.e., gender and birthplace) and household‐level factors (i.e., number of children in the household, number of working adults, and household income). The findings highlight the importance of incorporating children's views into our understanding of child poverty."

Political, economic and military imperatives have formed the basis of their close relationship despite divergence of interests and political outlook on regional issues. Strong measures have been taken by both countries to reconcile the differences and consolidate their ties. China's concerns regarding the perceived dangers of extensive US presence in Afghanistan and the challenges it faces following such development in its neighbourhood, have deeply influenced the vitality of China-Afghanistan relationship. A conceptual framework that consists of (a) state as a unitary actor (b) rationality and (c) national interest has been used to analyse the evolution of Sino-Afghan relations. This article argues that considering China's leverage in the global affairs combined with its close connection with the main shareholders in the Afghan conflict and Afghanistan's needs and willingness for cooperation, make China a natural partner for the Kabul government."

This paper presents an asymmetry–coercion linkage to explain the relationship between a great power and small states by reconceptualizing Albert Hirschman's theory of trade dependency. This reconceptualization involves two tasks. First, the paper explicates vulnerability to coercion as a consequence of economic asymmetry, whereby a small state becomes susceptible to a great power's compellence or co-optation to take a certain path preferred by the latter. Second, in demonstrating and measuring vulnerability to coercion, the paper accounts for the three factors: trade concentration, non-transparency, and reliance on bilateral aid. The combined effect of these three factors is that among the six countries under investigation, Cambodia and North Korea are extremely vulnerable to China's coercion, while Vietnam is the least vulnerable state."

Although much discussion is devoted to their respective strategic orientations and policy preferences in world affairs, more deep-rooted factors like norms and values should also be taken into consideration. This article follows a social constructivist approach to explicate how international norms have shaped the convergent and divergent actions of China and the EU in two empirical cases: the Iranian nuclear issue and the Syrian civil crisis. It argues that because China and the EU had both internalized the international norm of multilateralism, they could cooperate in pushing for a political solution to the Iranian nuclear issue through multilateral negotiations, and take a similar approach to the Syrian civil crisis. However, whereas China has seriously questioned the 'responsibility to protect' as a legitimate norm, the EU has embraced and promoted it. Consequently, the two took divergent actions in the second case. It is suggested that China and its Western partners closely engage each other in constructive communication to promote mutual understanding, and ultimately expand the basis of their common norms."
China and the Northwest Passage.,"Byers, Michael; Lodge, Emma",Chinese Journal of International Law,Oxford University Press / USA,INTERNATIONAL trade; WATERWAYS; LAW & legislation; CHINA-United States relations; NORTHWEST Passage; CANADA -- Foreign relations,,"As climate change continues to melt Arctic sea-ice, the Northwest Passage will likely see more international cargo shipments in the future. Since China is the world's largest trading and shipping state, a significant portion of that traffic can be expected to involve Chinese companies. For this reason, it is widely assumed that China will eventually side with the United States in its longstanding dispute with Canada about the legal status of the Northwest Passage and assert that the waterway constitutes an ""international strait"". This assumption may prove to be incorrect as China has practical and legally strategic reasons to side with Canada, especially because of similarities between the Northwest Passage and the Qiongzhou Strait. This article thus suggests it may be mutually beneficial for both Canada and China to recognize each other's ""internal waters"" positions in these two waterways."
China and Venezuela: South-South Cooperation or Rearticulated Dependency?,"To, Emma Miriam Yin-Hang; Acuña, Rodrigo",Latin American Perspectives,Sage Publications Inc.,JOINT ventures; VENEZUELA -- Economic conditions,China; Dependency; Energy cooperation; Neoextractivism; Venezuela,"China's increased participation in the world market and its consequent demand for energy has contributed to exacerbating the vulnerability of many externally oriented resource-rich countries. As a consequence, since the early 2000s the relationship between China and Venezuela has gone far beyond trade to an ""energy cooperation"" model with joint ventures and development funds not only in oil but also in nonresource sectors of the Venezuelan economy. Despite massive increases in social expenditure, Latin American theorists arguing from a neo-dependency perspective have questioned the long-term benefits of this so-called cooperation. They have characterized the relationship as ""neoextractivist"" in reference to the historically dependent relationship between Latin America and countries in the Global North. Whether the relationship is seen as based on South-South cooperation or on rearticulated global political and economic inequalities depends on whether the focus is on the behavior of the Chinese state and Chinese companies or on bilateral agreements between the two states. Although politically the relationship is based on cooperation, economically it displays many of the structural problems that Venezuela has faced since the discovery of oil.La mayor participación de China en el mercado mundial y la consiguiente demanda de energía han contribuido a exacerbar la vulnerabilidad de muchos países ricos en recursos con orientación externa. Como consecuencia, desde principios de la década de 2000, la relación entre China y Venezuela ha ido mucho más allá del comercio a un modelo de ""cooperación energética"" con empresas conjuntas y fondos de desarrollo no solo en el sector petrolero sino también en los sectores de la economía venezolana fuera de los recursos. A pesar de los aumentos masivos en el gasto social, los teóricos latinoamericanos que argumentan desde una perspectiva neo-dependentista han cuestionado los beneficios a largo plazo de esta llamada cooperación. Han caracterizado la relación como ""neoextractivista"" en referencia a la relación históricamente dependiente entre América Latina y los países del Norte Global. Si se considera que la relación se basa en la cooperación Sur-Sur o en desigualdades políticas y económicas globales rearticuladas depende de si la atención se centra en el comportamiento del estado chino y las empresas chinas o en los acuerdos bilaterales entre los dos estados. Aunque políticamente la relación se basa en la cooperación, económicamente muestra muchos de los problemas estructurales que Venezuela ha enfrentado desde el descubrimiento del petróleo."

The narrative assumes that there is a singular liberal order and that it is obvious what constitutes a challenge to it. The concepts of order and challenge are, however, poorly operationalized. There are at least four plausible operationalizations of order, three of which are explicitly or implicitly embodied in the dominant narrative. These tend to assume, ahistorically, that U.S. interests and the content of the liberal order are almost identical. The fourth operationalization views order as an emergent property of the interaction of multiple state, substate, nonstate, and international actors. As a result, there are at least eight ""issue-specific orders"" (e.g., military, trade, information, and political development). Some of these China accepts; some it rejects; and some it is willing to live with. Given these multiple orders and varying levels of challenge, the narrative of a U.S.-dominated liberal international order being challenged by a revisionist China makes little conceptual or empirical sense. The findings point to the need to develop more generalizable ways of observing orders and compliance."

Official development finance from China has risen tremendously in the past two decades across the globe, including in the world's poorest continent Africa. How has this sudden increase in development resources affected the two major multilateral development banks (MDBs) in the region, the World Bank and the African Development Bank (AfDB)? One might expect that the MDBs would compete with China to maintain influence in Africa. This study uses statistical tests and interviews with government officials in three recipient countries to see if this is the case. The results indicate that total MDB finance by country change little over time in response to Chinese activity. The sectoral allocation of concessional lending to the poorer countries does not show any responsiveness either. In contrast, shifts in levels and sector allocation can be observed for non-concessional countries. Overall, the study suggests that while China's role in African development finance is indeed substantial and growing, it has not had the ""game changing"" impact on traditional development finance as popular perception might lead one to believe. This may change, however, once more recipient countries develop economically and move to non-concessional lending."

Having analyzed the volumes, dynamics, branch and regional specifics of China's investments in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan, the authors conclude that they can be described as a new form of realization of China's geopolitical interests in Central Asia and Russia. They have identified new forms of Chinese migration in the context of China's expanded investments beyond its borders, involvement of Chinese citizens in the ""golden visa"" programs in Europe and Mediterranean countries and revealed that, more likely than not, labor migrants follow the flows of Chinese money and business migrants, consolidating the economic and geopolitical aspects of Beijing's foreign policy. The authors have discussed the geopolitical, sociocultural, and economic role of Chinese diasporas in promoting the interests of their homeland and pointed out that the forms of Chinese influence in the world have become more varied."

This bodes well for China's exercise of regional leadership in a long-term perspective."

Ideologically, it is framed in a peculiar blend of Marxism and China's traditional philosophy. China's trade policy and drive to receive needed natural resources, such as gas, fits in with these generations-long plans. Beijing has taken into consideration not just purely economic but also geopolitical implications. Following this model, Beijing appeals either to Moscow or Washington and changes the engagement pattern to achieve the desired result. Although using one power against the other is not a peculiarly Chinese way of dealing with outsiders, China has a clear advantage, for its totalitarian government could plan for generations and could change course regardless of the wishes of the electorate or clearly defined interest groups, as is the case with the modern capitalist West."

After years of frustration over North Korea's nuclear and missile development, the 70th anniversary of the founding of the DPRK in September was an occasion for consolidating the China-DPRK friendship. Prospects for regional coordination on North Korea, however, have been hindered due to challenges of implementation of international sanctions and deadlocked US-DPRK denuclearization negotiations. The focus on inter-Korean progress both overshadowed and enabled the gradual recovery of China-South Korea economic and political relations, but progress on North Korea's broader regional integration remains murky, and the regional dimension of the Korean puzzle remains unclear."

During the SARS crisis, China and the World Health Organization (WHO) entered a norm conflict over the precedence of sovereignty or global health security. Both resorted to behavioural, not discursive contestation: while the WHO practically but not rhetorically challenged the sovereignty norm by acting according to the norm of global health security, China—without openly acknowledging it—contravened the basic principles of global health security by acting according to the overlapping sovereignty norm. Why and with what consequences do actors choose to contest norms through actions rather than words? The article accounts for the resort to behavioural contestation by pointing to the strategic advantages it offers for furthering a contentious norm understanding without facing the social costs of making it explicit. It furthermore highlights that behavioural contestation may feed back into and change the odds of discursive contestation as its practical effects provide rhetorical resources to (de-)legitimate one or the other position. The propositions are illustrated in the interactions of China and the WHO during the SARS crisis and the subsequent norm development.

It unpacks the nature of China's engagements with Africa's oil-producing states and challenges the views of those who claim that emerging China-Africa relations are based on a ""new colonial"" scramble for Africa's resources, particularly oil. The commentary advances an alternate view based on Africa's agency in shaping its relations with China and posits that African petrostates and elites are in a position to determine if the outcome of oil engagements with China will connect to a project of national and continental development, or not."

Despite China's fast-growing foreign policy competence, the level of confidence held by China in engaging with global governance systems has not yet fully transmitted to the legal institutions governing human rights issues, and the ICC is such an example. This article examines specific policy concerns of China regarding the ICC in light of China's engagement with global governance, and some of the traditional concerns that have had an impact on that engagement. It discusses the extent to which these concerns should still be regarded as policy barriers preventing China's full accession to the ICC in years to come."

According to the thesis, the economic and security spheres of the region have become divorced from one other, whereby China and the United States dominate the economic and security realms, respectively. This paper demonstrates the deficiencies of this thesis, based on a comprehensive assessment of the economic and security developments in the region, as well as the strategic choices of small and middle regional powers. In order to form a more accurate and systematic understanding of regional prosperity and stability, this paper develops an economy-security nexus approach by integrating the interactions of regional actors in both the economic and security realms into a unified framework. From this perspective, East Asian regional order is sustained by a delicate coupling of regional economic and security configurations: 'hot economics' is accompanied with cooperative security interactions. Although China and the United States are not the dominant actors in either field, their relatively benign interactions in both realms collectively play a significant role by shaping the strategic environment for regional actors, allowing them to enjoy a large degree of strategic flexibility and increase their security and prosperity."

Considering the long-term implications for U.S. strategy, the research seeks to anticipate future trends in the Sino/Russia relationship using scenario planning techniques to develop four distinct yet impactful scenarios for policymakers to consider. From a list of highlighted ""driving forces"" in the Sino/Russia relationship, the research points to two critical uncertainties (U.S. policy and Central Asia) that could dictate the future relationship between the two powers. The scenarios include hypothetical events in a multitude of areas, which could have significant consequences for the two countries. The study recommends a change in U.S. policy that accounts for the growing environmental and technological tensions that are driving current geopolitical unrest in the developing world and suggests that a change is taking place in how the global community defines, conceptually, the role of great-power politics"

The development strategy formulated by Deng Xiaoping to modernize the Chinese economy under one-party rule generated endemic corruption and regime decay, but failed to institute genuine and enforceable political reforms that would prevent the return of a Mao-like figure. China's great leap backward since 2012 may dim the hopes of gradual evolutionary regime transition, but the pitfalls of strongman rule, dissipating economic dynamism under state capitalism, and escalating strategic competition with the United States will most likely reduce the long-term odds of the survival of the Chinese Communist Party."
China’s social credit systems and public opinion: Explaining high levels of approval.,"Kostka, Genia",New Media & Society,"Sage Publications, Ltd.",PUBLIC opinion; SOCIAL systems; SOCIAL structure; CHINA; CITY dwellers; OLDER people; COMPUTER privacy; GUANXI,China; public opinion; rating systems; reputational systems; social credit system; social management,"A variety of commercial and local government social credit systems (SCSs) are now being implemented in China in order to steer the behavior of Chinese individuals, businesses, social organizations, and government agencies. Previous research finds that these SCSs are employed by the Chinese state as “surveillance infrastructure” and for social management. This article focuses on a different angle: the public’s opinion of SCSs. Based on a cross-regional survey, the study finds a surprisingly high degree of approval of SCSs across respondent groups. Interestingly, more socially advantaged citizens (wealthier, better-educated, and urban residents) show the strongest approval of SCSs, along with older people. While one might expect such knowledgeable citizens to be most concerned about the privacy implications of SCS, they instead appear to embrace SCSs because they interpret it through frames of benefit-generation and promoting honest dealings in society and the economy instead of privacy-violation."

Based on ethnographic fieldwork, this article examines informal governance mechanisms that co-ordinate the circulation of goods and capital between China and Africa. The question addressed is: What roles do mobility and sojourning play in governing trade relations? The analysis is informed by research from three fields: economics scholarship on the trade–migration nexus, ethnographic studies of informal trans-border trade, and historical accounts of long-distance trade in pre-colonial and colonial eras. These traditions point to different ways in which the mobility of people and goods are interlinked. In the case of China–Africa interactions, the flow of goods has increased in tandem with the number of visits by African itinerant traders. The empirical discussion demonstrates that the emergence of intercontinental movements of goods and people between China and Africa was predicated on the brokering role played by African sojourners in Guangzhou. Of particular importance was informal hospitality and logistics infrastructure set up by Africans in the late 1990s, which subsequently evolved and adapted. This infrastructure has facilitated the mobility of people and goods and increased the pace at which trading capital circulates."

First, China's merchandize trade balance with ASEAN has shifted from deficit to surplus since 2012. This reflects China's improving comparative advantage in manufacturing production vis-à-vis ASEAN as a whole. Second, with China's wage hike, ASEAN investors can no longer take advantage of China's cheap labor force. Concurrently, China's investment in ASEAN has been increasing and become more diversified, ranging from energy to manufacturing and services. Singapore has remained the most important investment destination for Chinese investors and the largest foreign investor in China among ASEAN countries. Third, China has comparative advantages in providing construction, telecommunications, computer and information services and other business services to ASEAN. On the other hand, ASEAN, led by Singapore, has opportunities in the financial services and tourism markets in China. Finally, the development of economic regionalism, notably the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership and Trans-Pacific Partnership, will remain critical for the CAFTA's relevance in regional economic integration, as well as China–ASEAN relations in the future."

The structural factors are mainly geopolitical factors determined by national strength, geographical features and international status. Hard factors mainly include border conflicts, Tibetan issues, China–Pakistan relations and water disputes, which are difficult to solve and highly sensitive. Soft factors include a trade imbalance, visa issues, different notions of history, strategic differences, and the relationship between the two countries on the international stage. These three kinds of factors are differentiated. Their importance and influence on China–India relations are also changing. Geopolitical factors have begun to play more important role in the bilateral relationship of the two rising countries in the past few years, leading to their strategic competition. This competition has grown despite the fact that the two countries have not yet achieved a status as leaders of world politics. This premature strategic competition will hinder the development of the two countries and will make the ""Asian century"" hard to realize. For the security and interests of both nations and Asia as a whole, China and India must establish a more stable geopolitical relationship, promote bilateral cooperation in the field of hard and soft factors, and find opportunities for cooperation in new areas and spaces. Finally, China and India need to build a new type of power relations."

This study finds that the patterns of naval buildup and nature of the seas as an ambiguous, international medium do not necessarily shape mutual perceptions between China and India as pure security seekers. India's concerns about China's IOR forays revolve around its expanding bluewater naval capabilities, especially submarines, and port access. Beijing is wary of New Delhi's reach into the Western Pacific and role within a perceived US-led containment scheme that allows it to leverage on partners' bluewater assets. While war remains a remote prospect, this Sino-Indian rivalry at sea - extending from unresolved terrestrial political problems - looks set to persist."

Oman tends to get overlooked in surveys of relations between the People's Republic of China (PRC) and the countries of the Gulf. Oman's official sovereign wealth fund, the General State Reserve Fund, combined forces with the PRC's China Merchants' Holding International to initiate an ambitious scheme aimed at upgrading the Tanzanian port of Bagamoyo and constructing a special economic zone outside the town. Taken together, these considerations have led India to respond to China's pronounced engagement with Oman in a way that leaves neither state at a strategic advantage relative to the other and yet boosts the level of mutual mistrust and animosity."

Based upon its geostrategic location and vast maritime experience, Pakistan has promoted China's growing interests in the Indian Ocean and received China's economic, technological and military assistance in return. India has responded to these developments by expanding its naval power, adding a nuclear component and aligning with like-minded states. The paper concludes that a lack of institutional mechanisms, coordination and trust among the three can potentially expand their rivalry seawards, triggering a new naval arms race."

Given the competitive dynamic between these two countries, we might expect this competition to extend to their activities in global governance. In this article we develop and apply the concepts of 'status domain' and 'status good characteristics' to examine the extent to which Sino-Indian status competition is exacerbated or mitigated in three status-bearing areas: UN peacekeeping operations, Security Council membership, and Security Council behaviour. We find that status competition between the two countries, at least within the UN, is not always the dominant outcome. International organizations that allow for separate status domains, and also for the expression of a shared global vision, can mitigate status competition between states."

But while much attention has focused on how the BRI fits into China's-and specifically Xi Jinping's-grand narrative of national rejuvenation, less has been said about regional narratives-that is, the narratives of China's target audiences. Toward addressing this oversight, I consider the case of Singapore in relation to BRI. Specifically, I give attention to strategic narratives that offer analytic windows into the complex relationships being negotiated between China and Southeast Asian states. Strategic narratives, as instruments of policy, also play roles in constructing the strategic space in which BRI enters, with implications for the opportunities and constraints faced by China in Southeast Asia."

Relative to the South China Sea dispute, China uses the BRI as a means to ease and stabilize its strained relations with claimant countries like the Philippines. The BRI has enabled China to influence the Philippines in changing its policy on Chinese maritime expansion in the South China Sea. Lured by the BRI, President Rodrigo Roa Duterte is undoing his predecessor's policy of balancing China's expansive claim in the disputed waters. Based on his calculation, the Philippines will benefit from the BRI initiative—particularly in the revival of the maritime silk route—as it dovetails with his administration's massive infrastructure build-up program. In conclusion, the article contends that President Duterte is convinced that his appeasement policy toward China is worth pursuing because it makes the Philippines a beneficiary of the BRI. However, 3 years into his term, he has yet to see the implementation of BRI-funded infrastructure projects, which have been delayed by technical problems, the Philippine military, and the Filipino people's distrust of China because of the South China Sea issue in particular, and its behavior as emergent power in East Asia in general."

All of the six land bridges and maritime routes under the BRI extend westward, mostly passing through Central Asia and the Middle East on land or by sea. Cooperation with countries in these regions will, according to China's design, meet its domestic energy needs, and grow the country's economy. China recognizes, however, that in Central Asia and the Middle East, the risks posed by what it calls the ""Three Evils"" — terrorism, extremism, and separatism can impact the success of the BRI. They can also impact stability in its own adjacent areas, including Xinjiang. Therefore, in concert with the BRI, China is also identifying and deploying bilateral and multilateral diplomatic mechanisms aimed at security coordination with BRI countries in these two volatile regions. This article provides an overview of BRI developments in the two regions and examines some of the diplomatic mechanisms China is using to coordinate security and reduce risks."

It makes as its focal point the connectivity between China and Eurasia, South Asia, and the Indian Ocean. South Asia's location presents China with significant strategic opportunities as Beijing seeks to expand its economic presence in the subcontinent by providing resources in infrastructural development, particularly the construction of seaports. With growing Chinese trade and investment in the region, Beijing is also extending its diplomatic influence into what has long been considered as India's sphere of influence. With longstanding strategic distrust and unresolved territorial disputes, New Delhi is suspicious of Beijing's intentions and concerned over the latter's growing influence into a region it has long considered its sphere of influence. In this context, the BRI has the potential to intensify Sino–Indian rivalry, and the Modi government has indeed explored and launched initiatives to counter Chinese diplomatic activities. It remains a challenge whether and how Asia's rising powers can reduce their trust deficits and explore areas of cooperation made possible by the BRI, working toward a cooperative, mutually beneficial future for Sino–Indian relations and the region as a whole."

By using data from the American Enterprise Institute through descriptive statistics approach, the authors will test their hypotheses through 54 investment project examples whose individual value exceeds 100 million US$ in a period from January 2008 to December 2018. The research aims to describe the trends of Chinese investment projects in the Balkans in terms of investment volume, the sectors in which they are placed and the investment pattern. The foreign investment process is one of the crucial things for any global firm to get better results in the international business market. Through the BRI, Chinese companies have achieved this aim so far. Nevertheless, this paper will offer initial findings of those claims that can be used in the future as the primary database for upcoming research to see if types, level and field of Chinese investments remained the same in the Balkans. This research is among the first studies dealing with the analysis of Chinese investment projects in the Balkans. From a theoretical standpoint, it will fill the gaps in the literature and also show the importance and impact of Chinese investments on the Balkan's economy, especially in sectors such as energy and transportation."

Guided by the principle of China's core interests, has China achieved expected results of the foreign policy practice? The recent development of China's relations with the international society, especially with the West, does not support a positive answer. Questions raised here are: If China continues to stick with the principle of China's core interests, how does China play it out in dealing with international relations? Is it necessary for China to reinterpret its core interests in its foreign policy practice in order to better serve the win–win cooperation within the liberal international order? This paper will address these questions by examining the relationship between the notion of China's core interests and its foreign policy practice, and argue that China could worsen its foreign relations if it were to overemphasize the principle of China's core interests in foreign policy practice. China should revisit the notion of its core interests and modify it in order to handle serious challenges from the international society."

This article examines the key drivers behind China's 2011 decision to opt for ETS as a GHG mitigating policy tool and what lay behind the choice of the system's design features. Given the existence of the frontrunner EU ETS and that market mechanisms have spread across the world in recent years, we analyze the role played by policy diffusion in the decision to launch an ETS and in the subsequent design process, seen in relation to domestic drivers. The article investigates policy developments culminating in the 2011 carbon market announcement, and the reasons these design elements were chosen for the pilot schemes and the national market in the period 2011–2017. The article contributes to our understanding of policy diffusion at different stages of policy development in China, by revealing which diffusion mechanism is more prevalent at different stages. We find first that overall domestic conditions and drivers had the most consistent impact on policy decisions to establish a carbon market and on the selected sectors. However, a second key finding is that the role of policy diffusion varied over time, with such diffusion, in the form of ideational impact, playing the most important role early on, providing a powerful inducement for China to go for a carbon market. Third, sophisticated learning from international projects took place in the pilots, allowing China to adapt policies and design features to match local conditions."

It argues that recent China–ASEAN relations are based on Beijing's successful implementation of a dual strategy of coercion and inducement. The effectiveness of this strategy is tested against the South China Sea disputes – the issue that lies in the core of regional security and a key platform of power display. The article outlines Beijing's recent interaction with individual ASEAN member-states and its implications for the regional multilateral diplomacy. While by no means identical, Beijing's dual strategy of coercion and inducement with individual ASEAN states have resulted in an effective abuse of the ASEAN consensus principle – a tactic often referred to as 'divide and rule'. Consequently, the group's internal discord has further eroded and affected the institutional confidence of ASEAN. This article draws attention to the psychological effect of coercion as a perception of punishment, and inducement as a perception of reward."

In recent years, Chinese economic engagement patterns have been met with increasing skepticism due to their lack of transparency, their sino-centric as well as politically intrusive character. On the other hand, China remains a major contributor to economic and infrastructural development for numerous countries and has proven to be a reliable partner able to deliver on complex projects in limited time. As a consequence, many countries face internal political dilemmas regarding Chinese economic engagement, leading governments and decision-makers to adopt a wide range of attitudes towards Chinese capital and expertise. This paper aims at identifying political dilemmas created by Chinese investments by comparing Chinese economic engagement strategies in BRI's flagship project, the China Pakistan Economic Development Corridor, and the ones that failed in BRI's ""dead-end"": North Korea. While Pakistan and North Korea are very different economies, examining reasons that led the Pyongyang leadership to refuse to join the BRI initiative with current political debates in Pakistan around the CPEC and the ""Pak-China Friendship"" could help identifying and analyzing some salient features of Chinese economic engagement strategies abroad and the political dilemmas they imply for host countries."

Many analysts believe that the ambitious Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) represents the continuation and even intensification of that interest. I unpack the role of China's economic power in its external relations by focusing on how Guangxi, a subnational government in China, has facilitated the emergence of the BRI. My study suggests that in-depth knowledge about local governments' activism in socioeconomic engagements with neighboring countries contributes significantly to a more nuanced understanding of China's power, particularly its economic power in Asia."

China's Energy Diplomacy: Does Chinese Foreign Policy Favor Oil-Producing Countries?,"Lee, Chia-yi",Foreign Policy Analysis,Oxford University Press / USA,ECONOMIC development; DIPLOMACY; NATIONAL interest; ENERGY consumption; CHINA,,"Due to its rapid economic growth and increasing demand for energy, China has engaged in numerous efforts to sustain its energy supplies and enhance its energy security. While existing literature argues that access to energy is oftentimes the driving force behind Beijing's foreign policy behavior, little work has been done to systemically examine the bilateral relationship between China and energy-producing countries. This paper explores how China's foreign policy making is influenced by its energy security concern, focusing on three foreign policy instruments—partnerships, foreign aid, and leadership visits. Using a large- N , quantitative approach, this paper analyzes the effect of oil production on these three foreign policy indicators. The results show that Beijing is more likely to form partnerships with oil-producing countries. Top Chinese leaders are also more likely to travel to countries that produce a higher level of oil. China's aid allocation to Africa is driven by oil abundance as well, although the findings on aid are only valid in the cross-national analysis."

However, China's intentions in exercising future global leadership are yet unknown and difficult to extrapolate from its often contradictory behaviour. A preliminary overview of China's island building in the South China Sea reveals its potentially coercive intentions. This inference is consistent with the analysis of those who prognosticate China's violent rise. Conversely and simultaneously, China's participation in peacekeeping operations and its global investments evince its benevolent hegemonic intentions, which are congruent with the argument of those who predict China's peaceful hegemonic ascent. Confronted with these divergent tendencies in China's recent international relations, and assuming its continued rise, it is, thus, essential to examine China's strategic intentions and how these may ultimately project its violent or peaceful hegemonic rise. This article argues that the ""Third Way"" or ""Dutch‐style"" hegemony is highly instructive in this context and, thus, should be examined and added to the existing debate on China's rise as either a benevolent or coercive hegemon. We argue that Dutch‐style hegemony may be the most viable way for China to proceed in its global hegemonic ascendancy."

We argue that there has been a shift in the identity of Trinidad's state-society complex due to the influence of China's very visible political, economic, and social conditionalities. Their impact on political elites (which is reflected in government discourse and actions) and on the society at large (as shown by interviews with 30 Trinidadian nationals) is analyzed in order to show that Type I, 'role playing' socialization has been reached. However, frustration within Trinidad's society with the domestic effects of China's economic and social conditionalities clearly limits the potential for the evolution toward the more advanced Type II socialization exemplified, in the same region, by the Soviet-Cuban relationship. This suggests that, at least in the near future, key features of the Chinese approach incompatible with its self-proclaimed win-win nature will prevent Beijing from upgrading its status to that of a decisive socializer in the Caribbean."

However, the Chinese government recently enacted bans on imports and exports of ivory (2015) and on the domestic ivory trade (2017). These bans appear to have come in response to intensive influence campaigns and public shaming from domestic and foreign activists, who cited declining elephant populations and highlighted China's role. However, this shaming-narrative is at odds with conventional wisdom regarding Chinese policy-making: China typically resists international pressures and its authoritarian government is thought to be largely insulated from domestic efforts by civil society groups. This article reconciles Beijing's ivory policy with these conventional beliefs about policy-making in China. I argue that the Chinese government saw unique benefits to banning the ivory trade, under growing international scrutiny, as doing so enhanced Chinese soft power while having very little impact on its sovereignty or development. Non-government organizations (NGOs) operating both inside and outside of China played a role as well: NGOs in China helped to shift Chinese public opinion towards favouring the bans, while those operating abroad led public relations efforts to publicize Chinese demand for ivory to foreign audiences. Efforts by the latter group of NGOs intensified pressure on the Chinese government to rein in the ivory market, while increasing the soft power benefits that banning ivory would bring to Beijing."

By adopting content analysis to examine 53 articles written by Chinese elites, this study analyzes how the concept of China's new role in the Middle East is understood by this group. In particular, it addresses the following questions: What is new about China's new role? What are the policy debates of Chinese elites? And, has China's policy fundamentally changed or not? This study finds that the concept of ""China's new role in the Middle East"" is still under heated debate. This concerns what extent, and in which aspects, China should abandon the non‐interference and non‐involvement policy in the Middle East; whether China should identify itself as an order participant or order shaper; and which countries China should attach most importance to when conducting role adjustment in the region. The article also finds that China's elites and decision makers oscillate between prioritizing China's economic interests and geopolitical concerns with respect to this issue. This argument is tested by using the ordinary least squares model. The article concludes that the new role is too vague to be institutionalized at this stage, which reflects China's dilemma between expanding its influence and discursive power in the Middle East's rule‐setting, and trying to maintain its current risk‐aversion policy by not turning any Middle Eastern country or major international player in the region, such as the United States, into a hostile force."

It is based on openness, harmony, inclusivity, mutual benefit and market operations and aims to connect the economically vibrant East Asia and the developed Europe by land and by sea, and in the process, it brings growth and development to tens of countries along the modern Silk routes. In this paper, we compare the impact of the main initiatives of OBOR, namely enhancements in physical infrastructure and improvements in border administration, on the trade of countries that have signed on to this project, especially countries along the six economic corridors. We find overwhelming evidence that shows improvements in border administration has the greatest impact on exports of corridor countries. Although physical infrastructure is important for trade, the Chinese government should place equal attention to improvements in trade facilitation to ensure trade routes operate seamlessly across the various corridors."

This article analyzes 18 cases of China's participation/nonparticipation during 2003–2017, using such data as UN resolutions, data on trade and security, and other states' involvement. It reveals that the consideration of economic interests is a better predictor for China's behavior than China's concerns over its reputation, the insecurity of places, or mission characteristics. However, in contrast to popular speculations, economic interests are more about the importance of host states as export markets rather than as exporters of resource-related materials. The study also finds that sovereignty issues still wield power over China's decisions, showing that despite its increasing lenient voting patterns on mission resolutions, its participation behavior tends to remain conservative."

Rather than offering broad continental generalisations, or concentrating only on individual country case-studies, researchers and analysts would be better served by recognising and understanding the specific and varied regional contexts in which relations occur. Utilising Hettne's conception of regionalism and regionalisation processes, and over 100 field work interviews, the paper presents a broad continental overview of China's role in Africa followed by a more detailed case study of China's role in East Africa. The paper argues that the regional reality of African security dynamics enmeshes China into intra-regional geopolitics and complex local level security issues, and sees the relationship greatly affected by the varied behaviour and agency of the African leaders."

The authors also explore the fundamental ideas of traditional war philosophy used by modern war theoreticians of China in development of theory of cyber/information warfare. Specific examples of implementation of traditional concepts in cyberspace are presented. This topic is relevant and has practical importance, since study of conducting cyber operation in other countries, especially in China with a vast conceptual foundation, is necessary for development of own doctrine for conducting cyber/information operations. The main conclusion consists in the thesis that Chinese doctrine of cyber/information warfare is being actively developed based on the ancient philosophy of war intrinsic to Chinese culture. In one way or another, while searching for solutions to today's problems, Chinese theory of cyber/information warfare looks for solutions in its historical military practice."
China's Quest for Global Economic Governance Reform.,"Paradise, James F.",Journal of Chinese Political Science,Springer Nature,"INTERNATIONAL economic relations; INTERNATIONAL agencies; DEVELOPMENT banks; CHINA -- Foreign economic relations; GROUP of Twenty countries; XI, Jinping, 1953-",Belt and road initiative; China; G20; Global economic governance; Multilateral development banks,"This paper attempts to characterize China's approach to global economic governance during the Xi Jinping era, and to provide details on how it is playing out. One finding is that China has moved away from the period of ""hiding one's strength and biding one's time"" and is now acting in a more norm-making and agenda-setting role in which it is seeking largely incremental change. Another finding is that China is doing these things through a variety of global governance forms such as inter-governmental organizations with a fairly highly degree of formality, looser international organizations that have weaker implementation capacity and unilateral initiatives which put China very much in a leadership position. Findings are based on an examination of major activities of the Xi period, including hosting the G20 leaders' summit in Hangzhou, China, joint creation of new multilateral development banks, and the Belt and Road Initiative. The paper also touches on motives for China's activities, including hedging against adverse developments in the international system, greater wealth, and a global power vacuum that has arisen with the rise of nativist and populist movements in the West, and possible constraints to the realization of China's objectives such as slowing domestic economic growth and a backlash against China's globalization, which could intensify."

China's Response to Threats to Its Overseas Economic Interests: Softening Non-Interference and Cultivating Hegemony.,"Zou, Yizheng; Jones, Lee",Journal of Contemporary China,Taylor & Francis Ltd,ECONOMIC policy; HEGEMONY; CULTURAL imperialism; BALANCE of power; DOMINANT ideologies; CHINA; CHINA -- Foreign relations,,"Chinese firms have acquired enormous overseas interests since 2000. As relative latecomers to global markets, they often invest in territories subject to high political risk, which is often heightened by poorly regulated Chinese practices. This article describes these risks to China's growing overseas economic interests and explores China's response to them. First, the Chinese party-state is gradually softening its insistence on 'non-interference', intervening to secure Chinese economic interests overseas. Second, Chinese actors are seeking to cultivate greater consent among social forces in key states. This partial convergence with the practices of other major capitalist states has important implications for debates on China's rise. These arguments are illustrated through a case study of Chinese engagement in Myanmar after 2011."
China's rise and physical integrity rights in developing countries.,"Gamso, Jonas",Review of International Political Economy,Taylor & Francis Ltd,HUMAN rights violations; INTEGRITY; PANEL analysis; HUMAN rights; CHINA; DEVELOPING countries,checks; China; constraints; human rights; Trade; veto players,"China's rise has been met with concern by human rights scholars and activists. Critics contend that China is using its clout to weaken the international human rights regime while simultaneously empowering abusive governments in the developing world. Against this backdrop, this study investigates whether China's growing economic dominance has contributed to physical integrity rights violations in developing countries. Specifically, I theorize that China shields its major trade partners from international scrutiny, thereby weakening the external constraints that would otherwise prevent leaders from abusing human rights. Removing international-level constraints elevates the importance of domestic-level factors, such that whether China's partners do or do not repress physical integrity rights is contingent on domestic political institutions. Veto players are of particular importance because they can constrain leaders that have been otherwise empowered through trade with China. Within this context, I hypothesize that the number of veto players in a given country determines whether trading intensively with China leads to more violations of physical integrity rights. Through analysis of country-level panel data, I find evidence that trading with China worsens physical integrity rights abuses in developing countries. However, this effect is weaker where veto players are more numerous."

China's Silk Road Strategy and India's Apprehension.,"Pradhan, Ramakrushna",IUP Journal of International Relations,IUP Publications,INTERNATIONAL relations theory; REGIONAL differences; CHINA; SILK Road; PERCEPTION; BUSINESSPEOPLE,,"Although it was widely accepted that the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), like the ancient Silk Road, would revive the trade corridors from China linking Europe, Africa and Asia through regional energy markets, trade and transport hubs connecting business and people, thereby turning the entire region into an economic hub and evidently enhancing China's sphere of influence across the three continents, its strategic design of encircling India both through the BRI and String of Pearls has largely been ignored. This paper, in this context, argues that the One Belt One Road (OBOR) of China is an evolving international framework to develop a regional bulwark to consolidate its land and maritime position in Asia, thereby virtually reducing India to a non-power. The paper adopts the realist perspective of international relations theory to understand China's hidden agenda behind OBOR and to examine India's apprehension and urges New Delhi to formulate strategies to respond to the rise of China in Asian geopolitics."
China's sovereignty violations in the East and South China Seas: How should Europe respond?,"Southgate, Laura",European View,Sage Publications Inc.,,ASEAN; China; Europe; Japan; South China Sea; Southeast Asia; Sovereignty,"The EU has been content to remain a marginal actor in the maritime sovereignty disputes in the East and South China Seas. It has adopted a diplomatic strategy that stresses the importance of upholding freedom of navigation and confidence building between the states party to the conflict. As argued here, this approach does not take account of the crucial interests Europe has at stake in the conflict. It is made even less tenable by China's increasingly assertive behaviour towards securing its sovereignty in the region. Europe is at a crossroads: the EU may seek to overcome internal and external challenges to enhance its hard power capabilities, or it may continue to pursue a wholly soft power approach. Either way, how the EU deals with the current dispute will determine, in large part, its future role as a global security actor."

A ""temporary maintenance of the status quo"" marks the first stage, from 1951 to 1954. In the second stage, from 1955 to April 1960, China prepared for a negotiated settlement and proposed an East-West swap solution, with China's recognition of the McMahon Line as a prerequisite. In the third stage, from May 1960 to October 1962, judging that India was unwilling to negotiate a solution, China made preparations for deployment of its military and adopted a policy of ""never yield while striving to avoid bloodshed, create interlocking positions for longterm armed coexistence"" on the border issue, ultimately proceeding to the border conflict. This research analyzes the roles that domestic politics, Chinese leaders' perspectives, and dynamics related to the Cold War have played in China's strategies toward its border tensions with India. More importantly, based upon research in declassified archives, this article identifies the major issues of the Sino-Indian border dispute and hence attempts to provide a framework for China and India to build a mutually acceptable approach to future discussions as well as for formulating a resolution to the boundary issue."

It can be concluded that the empirical data confirm China's use of dollar diplomacy. In the case of most of the analysed countries capital flows and economic benefits were provided shortly before diplomatic ties were established. For all of the countries, their diplomatic recognition of the PRC enabled rich economic, trade, and development links with China. However, the volumes of capital flows were unstable and the awarding of economic advantages was not automatic and even in states which saw the biggest input of capital and the most lucrative economic deals, China's use of dollar diplomacy leaves several questions."

[Purpose] This article investigates why and how the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) under Xi administration has been vigorously trying to co-opt politically non-communist forces at home and abroad by means of the UFW. The above analysis also sheds ligt on the characteristics of Xi's political thought, leadership style as well as his idea of political strategy for the ""Great Rejuvenation of the Chinese Nation (zhonghua minzu weida fuxing)."" [Main Argument] In foreign activities, China's influence through developing various UFW institutional settings has been strengthened. However, its construction of human network which contributes to CCP's political aims and its maintenance of information flaw bases have been mostly made up of personal effort in the long-term activity of the UFW. [Conclusions] It is true that the democratic regimes need to adopt a cautious approach toward China's foreign influence, but to identify activities of the UFW in their homeland is not so much difficult because they are usually patterned in most cases. Then, in the research on the UFW, Xi Jinping's political conservativeness has again become highlighted. The basic orientation of his political thinking is not the reform and innovation of the regime, but the revival of 'good tradition' and renovation of the CCP."

Whereas existing studies have clarified the geopolitical context and the influence of China's international relations with other states, this one unlocks the connections between the war, China's post-Mao political succession struggle, and a long-standing dispute between the supporters of two distinct military doctrines—Mao's People's War strategy and, its rival, military modernization. To establish whether causation exists, this study first identifies the causal mechanism, then conducts a careful investigation of the relationship between the decision to go to war and the power struggle that raged in Beijing at the time. Process tracing is used to conceptualize and sequence six distinct stages in the causal chain between 1959 and 1981; that is, in the lead up to, during, and in the aftermath of the war. The primary conclusion is that, in addition to international considerations, Deng Xiaoping advocated the attack on Vietnam because it allowed him to accelerate military modernization and de-Maoification and thus defeat his political rival Communist Party Chairman Hua Guofeng and take control of China."

This article argues that Chinese arms deliveries have arrived in the region together with the expansion of commerce and trade routes as evidenced in Africa, Asia, and the Middle East. In Latin America and the Caribbean, states seek to buy weapons in light of contentious border hot spots and intrastate rampant violence. China is a wilful seller and, to accomplish this, it has developed a weapons transfer policy taking advantage of the post-hegemony of the United States. The article argues that Beijing's successes could reverse due to the lack of interstate armed conflict, and the less belligerent military missions adopted by the armed forces. Yet, Chinese arms transfers in the Western Hemisphere and other parts of the developing world reveal a complex security governance regime where the military, industry, and diplomatic policy communities interact."

The subject of this research is the approaches of China towards the problem of formation and development of this concept. The authors meticulously examine such aspects of this topic as the origin and evolution of this concept, as well as its role in the actual discourse in the United States. Special attention is given to the examination of the Chinese views on the concept of ""American exceptionalism"", which presents great interest with consideration of the fact the ""exceptionalism"" is not a new concept for China. The concept of ""sinocentrism"" emerged even earlier than the concept of ""American exceptionalism"". The scientific novelty of this research consists in the fact that this research is first to provide results of a comprehensive analysis of China's approaches towards the concept of ""American exceptionalism"", which is very relevant in light of both countries becoming the largest world powers and rivals in the international arena. Study of the foreign policy of each other therefore becomes a prerequisite for structuring harmonious foreign policy. The main conclusions of the conducted research consists in determination that Chinese authors either critically regard this concept, or with certain suspicion, since the United States use this concept to practically justify their involvement into the affairs of other countries, including military involvement."

Although Japanese expansionists certainly used the term and its concept in this way in the 1930s and 1940s, earlier proponents of Asianism looked upon it as a very real strategy of uniting Asian nations to defend against Western imperialism. Showing that Chinese intellectuals considered different forms of Asianism as viable alternatives in the early days of the Republic of China, this article examines a number of discussions of Asianism immediately following the 1911 Revolution. Concentrating on newspaper articles and speeches by intellectuals Ye Chucang and Sun Yat-sen, I show the international aspirations of the Guomindang elite at this crucial point in the construction of the Chinese nation. Despite the dominance of discourse on the nation state, these intellectuals advocated different Asianist programmes for strategic purposes within the first two years of the Republic, dependent on their very different relationships with Japan."

Chinese entrepreneurial migrants in Ghana: socioeconomic impacts and Ghanaian trader attitudes.,"Dankwah, Kwaku Opoku; Valenta, Marko",Journal of Modern African Studies,Cambridge University Press,EMIGRATION & immigration; SOCIOECONOMICS; COMMUNITIES; MERCHANTS; BUSINESSPEOPLE,,"This article explores attitudes of Ghanaian traders towards an increasing Chinese influx into Ghanaian trading spaces and the impacts of Chinese merchants on Ghanaian traders and trading spaces. Despite a late entrance of Chinese merchants into Ghanaian trading spaces relative to Lebanese, Indians and Nigerians, the abrupt change in size of the Chinese trading community along with its huge capital and cheap goods have had big impacts on local trading spaces. We maintain that relations between Ghanaian traders and Chinese counterparts may be roughly described as complementary, collaborative and competitive. While the Chinese impacts are seen as positive by some Ghanaian traders and landlords, they are negative for others. Yet, we argue that these relations are also nuanced and rooted in each Ghanaian trader's position amidst the Chinese presence. This article contributes to the literature on dynamics of South-to-South movements. It adds to growing studies on contemporary Chinese emigrations and accompanying impacts in host communities."

Recent evidence indicates that these postures are far more integrated, flexible, and dynamic than Beijing's official rhetoric suggests, and that during the past decade a de facto shift toward a limited nuclear war-fighting posture has already taken place. By applying an International Relations (IR) structural-realist lens to conceptualize a relatively under-researched discourse that relates to recent indications that China is contemplating the deployment of nuclear weapons for war-fighting (or victory-denial) purposes. A radical doctrinal shift of this kind (or even the perception of one) could presage a paradigm shift in China's long-standing nuclear posture and the nuclear balance in Asia."

Among other things, it contemplates possible links between Chinese outward FDI (OFDI) volumes and Argentina's domestic and foreign policies. It also analyses a mixture of successful and unsuccessful Chinese investment cases in the agricultural, chemical, and banking sectors in order to engage the debate about the drivers of Chinese OFDI (COFDI), with some stressing business and economic factors and others emphasizing the primacy of political factors. In regards to the former, my study shows that Argentine policymakers did not offer special accommodations to Chinese investors despite the pro-China proclivities of Argentine leaders and their country's economic and political need for China. Moreover, at the local level, Argentine politics actually proved to be an obstacle to successful Chinese deals. As for the latter issue, Chinese companies were not inclined to invest in Argentina because of the China stance of the Argentine government, but rather because they saw opportunities to exploit fertile agricultural soil, special tax regimes for investors, and opportunities to integrate into global value chain. My findings have a number of important theoretical and policy implications."

Structurally very similar to games played by Chinese immigrants in the USA, fahfee operations (or banks) provided an illicit accumulation strategy, which allowed entrepreneurial Chinese immigrants to survive at the margins of a discriminatory racial-capitalist order, and to use these enterprises as a platform to enter the mainstream white economy. Fahfee was a tactic through which the subordinate were able to contest and negotiate the repressive strategies of the socio-political elite. The discussion of fahfee is set against the background of successive waves of Chinese immigration to South Africa, from the slaves and convict labour imported by the Dutch East India Company in the 17th century to more recent immigration from Taiwan and the Peoples Republic of China. The article draws on a wide variety of historical material, the literature on both gambling and Chinese migration, and interviews with contemporary fahfee bankers."

Linkages with the West are supposed to facilitate democratization, whereas those with autocracies usually promote regime survival. This study focuses on Myanmar and Thailand's linkages with the U.S. and China, which at first sight seem to demonstrate the hypothesized effects. Myanmar gradually liberalized while strengthening its Western linkages, whereas Thailand experienced democratic breakdown amid a shift in alignment from the U.S. to China. However, in-depth analysis suggests that the influence of foreign linkages on domestic political change was minimal and that the relationship may very well be endogenous. The findings of this study call for a more careful theorization and handling of the external factors in studies of regime change and highlight the importance of simultaneously analyzing democratic and autocratic linkages."

Among these, real estate has emerged as one of the most rapidly increasing outbound investments from China in the 2010s. As a result, Chinese investors, both enterprises and individuals, have had an extensive and growing impact on host states and societies, which are largely developed and democratic. This study analyzes the multifaceted interactions between Chinese foreign real-estate investors and host states and societies using the case of Jeju Province in South Korea from 2010 to 2018. More specifically, it analyzes the responses of the host country’s national and local governments, as well as its grassroots civil society, to the soaring and often unconstrained Chinese investment in its real estate, focusing on the role of a host country’s democratic institutions."
Chinese IR Sino-centrism tradition and its influence on the Chinese School Movement.,"Peng, Lu",Pacific Review,Taylor & Francis Ltd,INTERNATIONAL relations; INTERNATIONAL relations theory; FOREIGN study; CHINESE schools; MOVEMENT education; THEORY of knowledge,Chinese IR history; Chinese School Movement; Sino-centrism tradition,"The Chinese School Movement, which aims to create a Chinese theory of international relations, has developed over the last 30 years. It is usually portrayed as an ongoing effort by Chinese scholars to provide a theory that accounts for anomalies within Western IR theories. Despite its academic potential, the movement has made extremely slow progress in theory building. This slow progress is attributed to the prevalence of the Sino-centrism in Chinese IR which assumes the superiority of Chinese international experience in knowledge making and evaluation. This epistemological tradition rises, falls, and resurges in Chinese IR disciplinary history and finds its latest expression in the Chinese School Movement, which turns it into a pseudo-scientific enterprise. Under its influence, the Chinese School Movement is constantly applauded by Chinese IR scholars despite the difficulty in yielding scientific output. The most urgent task for Chinese scholars is therefore not to further strengthen the Sino-centrism tradition by searching for a unique Chinese understanding of international relations but to deconstruct it for better communication between Chinese and Western IR scholars."

Although the demographics of these marriage migrants have transformed over the years, a misunderstanding still exists as migrant wives are seen as commodities and gaining citizen status is seen as their ultimate goal. Using in-depth interviews, this research takes a bottom-up approach by allowing Chinese migrant women in Taiwan to define and interpret their own citizenship. It explains how they negotiate the politics of citizenship as they confront harsher immigration restrictions than immigrants of other origins because of their Chinese identity. This paper suggests that immigrants' intersectional identities shape their conceptualization of Taiwanese citizenship, although their agency is limited. My findings illustrate that some Chinese migrant wives embrace citizenship entitlements while others' experiences with citizenship differ depending on their positionality in both the private and the public. My findings also show that some migrant wives actively reject Taiwanese citizenship, challenging the myth that all Chinese immigrants desire Taiwanese citizenship. This study contributes to citizenship and migration studies using a feminist, intersectional approach and raises implications for the degree to which migrant wives have agency in constructing their citizenship."

The author expounds three aspects of the Tao philosophy: administrative (perception of ideal form of government and political legitimacy), military-diplomatic (preferred types of interaction with other actors and stance on war as a political instrument), and geopolitical-geocultural (perception of culture in its place in the world and correlation of cultural mission with beingness of other actors withing the framework of certain world politics configuration). The scientific novelty of this research consists in a complex analysis of the ""Tao Te Ching"" texts as a potential paradigm of Chinese strategic culture. ""Tao Te Ching"" preaches noninvolvement as a method of government and criteria of political legitimacy, defensive pacifism and world politics model of global community of smaller states. A conclusion is made on the importance of study of the influence of Tao paradigm upon the strategy of Chinese national movements for solution of the problem of political strategic agency."

The traditional average treatment effect estimation methods cannot be used to consistently estimate yuan's pegged exchange rate. We develop a new estimation strategy by combining a novel panel data method (proposed by Hisao, Ching and Wan) and the purchasing power parity theory. Based on this new estimation strategy, we find that during the period of pegging to US dollar, Chinese yuan were undervalued. Before the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis, the pegged exchange rate regime starting from January 1994 made the yuan undervalued by 2.62%. China's accession to WTO caused yuan undervalued by 36.60%. After the reform of Chinese exchange rate policy in July 2005, the undervaluation of the yuan was reduced to only 0.76%. Yuan was undervalued again by 20.43% because of 2008 China's economy stimulus package. The policy reform in June 2010 made yuan overvalued by 14.40%. We conclude that Chinese fixed exchange rate policy indeed undervalued the yuan, especially after its accession to WTO. The recent reforms of Chinese exchange rate policy made progresses in re‐evaluating the yuan."

By analysing Chinese (mainly academic) literature, this article studies contemporary Chinese views of global economic governance. It finds that the 2008 financial crisis is a notable point of the Chinese discourse. In addition, dialogue platforms – the G20 in particular – rather than key institutions of global economic governance such as International Monetary Fund (IMF), World Bank and Word Trade Organization (WTO) win overwhelming attention in the Chinese discourse. Chinese views of global economic governance also highly value the role of the state, while paying less attention to Non Governmental Organisations (NGO) and civil society. Overall, this article highlights a diverse, shifting and sometimes contradictory Chinese discourse on global economic governance, which helps to develop a more accurate understanding of China's ambition in global economic governance."

We focus separately on a general analysis of attitudes and on Chinese responses to specific international events involving the United States. In general, we find that Chinese netizens are much more interested in US politics than US society. Their views of the United States are characterized by deep ambivalence; they have remarkably favorable attitudes toward many aspects of US influence, whether economic, political, intellectual, or cultural. Attitudes toward the United States become negative when the focus turns to US foreign policy – actions that Chinese netizens view as antithetical to Chinese interests. On the contrary, attitudes toward Japan, Russia, and Vietnam vary a great deal from one another. The contrast between these differentiated Chinese views toward the United States and other countries, on the one hand, and the predominant anti-Americanism in the Middle East, on the other, is striking."
Chinese–Russian economic relations: developing the infrastructure of a multipolar global political economy?,"Silvius, Ray",International Politics,Palgrave Macmillan Ltd.,ECONOMIC development; POLITICAL economic analysis; CHINA-Russia relations,China; Global political economy; Multipolarity; Russia,"This article situates Russian–Chinese relations within a wider emerging infrastructure of multipolarity to consider how such relations signal a complex and multifaceted 'decentering' of the global political economy beyond American-centered global governance architecture. Russian–Chinese economic cooperation and economic multipolarity have been some time in the making; however, they are demonstrating new institutional, governance, and reciprocal 'embeddedness.' The processes by which such embeddedness has occurred provide the context within which geopolitical and geoeconomic crises are mediated, not the reverse. This article traces emerging economic relations between Russia and China by moving beyond abstract and generalized pronouncements of multipolarity to consider the extent to which such multipolarity is realized via contemporary Russian–Chinese economic relations, and how such relations are constitutive of a post-hegemonic global political economy. The increased complexity of Russian–Chinese economic relations—means that any resultant effects on polarity cannot simply be deduced from each state's strategic preferences regarding polarity."

I argue that authoritarian regimes strategically pass on certain types of external pressure to their public to ""internationalize"" human rights violations, making citizens view human rights in terms of defending their nation internationally rather than in terms of individual violations, and making them more likely to be satisfied with their government's behavior. I find strong support for this model through statistical analysis of Chinese state media reports of external human rights pressure and a survey experiment on Chinese citizens' responses to pressure on women's rights. This analysis demonstrates that authoritarian regimes may be able to manipulate international human rights diplomacy to help them retain the support of their population while suppressing their human rights."

Citizen-to-citizen connectivity and soft power: The appropriation of subcultures in 'little freshness' across the Taiwan Strait.,"Lim, Song Hwee",China Information,"Sage Publications, Ltd.",SOFT power (Social sciences); SUBCULTURES; TAIWAN Strait,'little freshness'; citizen-to-citizen; connectivity; soft power; structure of feeling; subcultures; Taiwan Strait; youth,"This article takes as its object of analysis the term 'little freshness' (xiao qingxin 小清新), which has been coined to describe a variety of cultural products and phenomena, mostly emanating from Taiwan but circulating across the Taiwan Strait. It argues that little freshness is a manifestation of subcultures that have been initiated, appropriated, and consumed by youths in the region. This citizen-to-citizen connectivity reworks Joseph Nye's notion of soft power by shifting the focus away from state agents and by reversing the direction of soft power flows to claim agency at the sites of reception. The article provides two case studies to demonstrate how an imaginary about Taiwan's cleanness, clearness, and freshness has been projected by the media in the People's Republic of China as a form of discursive construction and by Hong Kong citizens of Taiwan as a desirable destination for emigration. Finally, the article situates the little freshness phenomenon in relation to a propensity towards miniaturization in cultural formation in the region, and suggests that this propensity is inflected in a structure of feeling about generational injustice in the face of neoliberal capitalism."

Focusing upon the evolution of Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region in China, this paper offers new insights into the close associations between Chinese city-regionalism and the geopolitical orchestration of national development. Rather than conceived as an inevitable outcome of contemporary globalization processes, the development of YRD region is instead examined against the changing geopolitical dynamics and national objectives of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) from 1949 to the present day. In the early phase of CCP rule, the development of regional urban centres, such as Shanghai in YRD region, was an instrument of national territorial integration and class unity. Following economic reforms in the 1980s, the formal designation of YRD as a city-region reflected the Chinese state's aspiration for accelerated economic growth and the internationalization of the domestic economy. Now confronted with widening regional inequalities, the Chinese state has greatly expanded YRD region to incorporate peripheral cities and provinces for the sake of regionally coordinated development. Even as YRD transforms into a global city-region, Shanghai seemingly separates itself functionally and discursively from the rest of the region. In departing from contemporary post-Westphalian or hyper-globalist perspectives on the rise of global city-regions in a stateless world, the paper provides a new interpretation of Chinese city-regionalism as a case of countervailing geopolitical processes at work within and beyond national state borders."
Clustering effects on firm exporting with productivity‐enhancing R&D in China.,"Howell, Anthony",World Economy,Wiley-Blackwell,EXPORTS; CHINA; INDUSTRIAL clusters; EXPORTERS,China; exporting; productivity; R&D; regional clusters,"This paper examines the effects of regional clustering on the linkages among R&D, exporting and productivity of Chinese firms. A structural framework is employed using a set of recursive equations that is capable of correcting for most estimation issues related to selection and endogeneity. The main findings reveal that regional clustering brings about relatively trivial direct benefits to exporters after taking into account important sources of firm heterogeneity. Rather, the main benefits of clustering on exporting appear to arise indirectly through investments in innovation and productivity. The main implication of the findings suggests that a better endowed geographical area improves international competitiveness mainly by enhancing the super‐additive effects of investments in technology on productivity, which, in turn, enhances exporting performance."

While the Yasukuni study is expanding, not much has been explored on the nature of public reactions to the controversy. This study explores Prime Minister Abe Shinzo's Yasukuni pilgrimage in 2013 and delves into Japanese public opinion on and around it. Overall, the Japanese public is relatively composed and prefers cautious approach; yet, at the same time, more people now support the official Yasukuni visits in general. This study also reveals discernible, yet nuanced, disagreements among PM Abe's Yasukuni policies, the public perceptions of them, and the narratives of major newspaper editorials on this issue. The coverage of public opinion polls by the major national newspapers uncovers the public opinion on (1) the official Yasukuni visit, (2) the idea of building an alternative non-religious national memorial, and (3) the Japanese public's decreasing sense of affinity toward China and South Korea (and their implications on understanding the Yasukuni issue and the sense of nation). The study will also examine the newspaper narratives on the controversy, which should help exemplify the overall public mood over the years."

Community Elites and Collective Action: The State and the Starved during the Chinese Famine (1959–61).,"Cai, Yongshun",Politics & Society,Sage Publications Inc.,,China; famine; peasant resistance; protest leaders,"Tens of millions of peasants died during the Great Famine in China from 1959 to 1961. Numerous Chinese peasants remained silent during the famine while others staged resistance. This article explores how peasant resistance was possible in a communist regime and how the government contained such resistance. It finds that resistance was considerably affected by the availability of protest leaders. Chinese peasants were organized into rural collectives controlled by the party-state through local cadres. Sympathetic rural cadres played crucial roles in facilitating peasant resistance. However, government control generally deprived rural communities of protest leaders. When collective resistance did occur, the government contained its influence through accommodation and repression. Effective control rendered the government insensitive to the famine suffered by the vast rural population of the country."
Community-based welfare targeting and political elite capture: Evidence from rural China.,"Han, Huawei; Gao, Qin",World Development,Elsevier B.V.,"PUBLIC welfare; COMMUNITIES; POLITICAL elites; POVERTY; VILLAGES; INCOME; RURAL population; CHINA; ECONOMIC conditions in China, 2000-",Income poverty; Multidimensional poverty; Political elite capture; Rural China; Welfare targeting,"Highlights • We use China Household Income Project (CHIP) 2013 data to systematically evaluate rural Dibao's targeting performance. • Rural Dibao's targeting performance was better based on multidimensional poverty than based on income poverty. • Dibao's intra-village targeting accounted for more of its targeting performance than inter-village targeting. • Political elite capture effects existed in Dibao's community-based targeting. • We find heterogeneous political elite capture effects, with those from close relatives larger than from household members. Abstract Using nationally representative rural household survey data from the 2013 China Household Income Project (CHIP) and decomposable targeting differential measures, this article systematically evaluates rural Dibao's targeting performance based on both income and multidimensional poverty measures, and investigates the effects of political elite capture in its community-based targeting (CBT) implementation. We found that rural Dibao's targeting performance was quite poor based on income poverty standards. When based on multidimensional poverty, Dibao's targeting performance was better than based on income poverty. Dibao's intra-village targeting accounted for more of its targeting performance than inter-village targeting. We also found political elite capture effects to exist for both Dibao participation and transfer value received. Moreover, the political elite capture effect from close relatives was larger in magnitude than that from household members. Having a household member being a village leader in the village of residence had no significant elite capture effect, whereas having members with a political leader position outside the village of residence or being a non-leader political party member was associated with a greater chance of welfare participation. These findings suggest that targeting errors in developing countries' CBT welfare programs such as China's rural Dibao is still substantial and political elite capture may be one important reason for them."

It argues that higher inter-ethnic integration can boost the capacity of titular elites to bargain with the centre, leading to more formal recognition of the titular language, even if not immediately augmenting its use in daily life; conversely, a more pronounced inter-ethnic divide can serve to sustain more vigorous informal use of the titular language, while at the same time impeding improvement of its formal status."
Comparative Orientalism in Latin American Revolutions: Antichinismo of Mexico and El Salvador.,"Chang, Jason Oliver",Latin American Research Review,Latin American Studies Association,ORIENTALISM; NATIONALISM; POSTCOLONIALISM; RACISM; HEGEMONY,,"Across Latin America, mestizo nationalism became a common response to postcolonial independence, revolt, and revolution in the twentieth century. These different mixed-race nationalisms have been the subject of continuous debate in Latin American studies. The field of Asian American studies offers a different approach that highlights the political and cultural function of anti-Chinese politics beyond their targeting of racialized Chinese subjects. This article examines the anti-Chinese politics and mestizo nationalisms of Mexico and El Salvador to question if and when popular Orientalist racism aided indigenous and peasant consent to state-sponsored mestizo nationalism. This methodology underscores the historical role that ideological formations of Asia and Asians have contributed to the political and cultural life of race in Latin America even when actual populations remained small or nonexistent. By understanding racial formations in a multiracial context I underscore the notion that anti-Chinese racism is not only important in that it discriminated against Chinese, but also that it served non-Chinese Latin Americans remarkably well and helped build an unstable equilibrium of mestizo hegemony."
Comparing income poverty gap and deprivation on social acceptance: A mediation model with interpersonal communication and social support.,"Zhang, Yin; Wong, Hung; Chen, Ji‐Kang; Tang, Vera M.

In their day‐to‐day lives, poor people often feel less accepted by the society. The failures in communicating with social groups and receiving social support lead to negative consequences on individual well‐being and higher level of social exclusion. Based on the debate upon alternative approaches to conceptualizing and operationalizing poverty, this study attempts to verify a mediation model with data from a household survey (N = 1,202) in Hong Kong. The results of structural equation modelling reveal that deprivation is a more powerful indicator than income poverty for specifying the negative relations of poverty with interpersonal communication, social support, and social acceptance; the negative impact of deprivation on social acceptance can be reduced by two significant mediators of interpersonal communication and social support. The results are discussed in terms of directions for future research and policy and welfare intervention."

The Behavioral Model for Vulnerable Populations (BMVP) is used to guide the secondary data analysis of a sample of 3,453 older Asian immigrants from the California Health Interview Survey (CHIS). Logistic and linear regression analyses are performed to examine predictors of mental health service use and the frequency of mental health service use, respectively. As results, mental health‐seeking patterns differ by ethnicity within the older Asian immigrant sample, not being married (Korean), higher levels of acculturation (Filipino), lower levels of neighborhood cohesion (Korean and Vietnamese), higher levels of perceived safety (Korean) and lower levels of perceived safety (Vietnamese), higher levels of mental distress (Korean and Filipino), and having perceived need (all) were related to more visits for mental health services.

Competing for father's love?

This article argues that apart from conventional antecedents, political salience defined by top leaders largely shapes government agencies' life cycle. In one of the first large‐N analyses of agency termination in a non‐Western authoritarian regime, we used longitudinal data for the central apparatus in China from 1949 to 1976 to test this hypothesis. We specifically used Chairman Mao's written directives to measure political salience and found that agencies that received more directives were less likely to be terminated. In contrast, agencies less attended to the boss were less likely to survive major restructurings. We also found that peripheral agencies (e.g., smaller, lower‐ranking agencies with noncore functions) benefited more from leaders' attention. We compare the results with the existing literature and suggest some theoretical and policy implications."

It claims that the Japanese strategy towards China between 2012 and 2018 has moved from confrontational competition to competitive cooperation over third‐country markets; this is because of their shared beliefs and methodology regarding regional development. The paper undertakes three major tasks. Firstly, it compares Chinese and Japanese academic discussions regarding East Asia. It finds that experts on both sides admit the significant implications of the politico‐economic divide in the regional system. However, the realistic Chinese tend to consider the divide as a problem to be solved through power, whereas the more liberal Japanese expect it to provide a coordinating function for the regional order as a whole. Secondly, the article reviews the shifts in the Japanese government's behaviours toward China in recent years. It argues that Japan has moved for collaboration with China to maintain the liberal rule‐based order in the region. Finally, founded on the estimate of China's economic leverage over its neighbours, the paper claims that Japan will expand its responsibility in order formation in East Asia in future, becoming more independent from American influences."

This study focuses on the flagship sector of high-speed railways (HSR) and examines what kinds of development financing China and Japan have adopted in making these investments. It asks the following questions: What similarities are there in the Chinese and Japanese approaches to investments in overseas infrastructure, and how do they differ from traditional Western development financing? Also, in what ways have China and Japan changed their approaches to overseas infrastructure projects during this process? It argues that in the process of expanding overseas infrastructure investments and competing for infrastructure projects, China and Japan have become 'competitive partners' in challenging the traditional norms of development financing represented by the Washington Consensus and the Development Assistance Committee (DAC). To be more specific, China and Japan have adopted each other's practices of tied commercial financing, heavy government involvement, focusing on physical infrastructure and industrialization, and showing respect for host-country forms of governance. In particular, by joining China in the new game of exporting infrastructure and through its own 'quality infrastructure investment' initiative, Japan has broken out of the constraints of DAC norms as an aid donor and endorsed some fundamental Chinese approaches to development and development cooperation, which in their turn were inspired by earlier Japanese practices."
Comprehensive Research Report on China's Current Issue of Mass Incidents Caused by Conflicts Among the People.,,Chinese Law & Government,Taylor & Francis Ltd,PETITIONS; EMPLOYEE rights; SOCIAL order; SOCIAL forces; CAPITALISM; CHINA; CITY dwellers; INDUSTRIAL management; RUMOR,,"In recent years, in particular since 1999, as some masses have harbored the thoughts that ""big results come from making big trouble and small results come from making small trouble"", more and more people adopt various extreme behaviors to vent their dissatisfaction, and mass incidents that are clearly oppositional in nature with fierce clashes have gradually increased, causing great harm to the state and people and seriously affecting social stability in some regions. Leaders from all levels of party committees and governments and all departments and work units should continually and enduringly persist in the aim of wholeheartedly serving the people, continually concern themselves with the troubles of the people, listen to the peoples' voices, enthusiastically help the masses resolve their difficulties, and truly do real deeds for the people. We should use continual, solidly effective work to let the people truly see the resolve of the party and government to punish corruption, gradually eliminate the widespread dissatisfaction among the masses, reduce the conflicts among the people resulting from this, and reduce the occurrence of mass incidents."

Initially, the term was rooted in Western IR school, and was elaborated as an attempt to counter-balance USSR in the context of bipolar world. The article also covers the modern practice of using multipolarity discourse in Western international political science. Particular attention is paid to the formation of the concept of multipolarity in the Russian Federation and in the PRC in the post-bipolar world. Academic discourse of multipolarity is presented in close link to the practical dimension of the foreign policy concepts of the countries mentioned in this study. The re-emergence of multipolarity was closely associated with changes in the balance of power and an attempt to overestimate the role of superpowers in the world. The consistent development of the theoretical basis of the concept was carried out until the end of the Cold War in the framework of the Western school of IR. In Russian and Chinese studies, multipolarity mostly acts as an image of the desired world order. In recent years, a number of Western scholars have recognized the objective nature of a multipolar world and the need for strategic adaptation to its realities."

It places the varieties of citizenship on a continuum, from punctual citizenship acts to the normative and highly demanding Aristotelian concept of citizenship. All premodern states, with the exception of China, were infra-structurally weak, leaving room for self-rule and citizenship acts in local, often urban, arenas. However, citizenship was also found in larger – frequently federal – states. In many states in pre-colonial Asia, people defended their entitlements, negotiated with the ruling elites and, though less often, participated in government. This resulted in 'quasi-rights', not guaranteed by written charters, and yet efficacious in limiting the power of the governing class. Apart from political citizenship, the essay discusses forms of social citizenship, in particular in the sphere of gender regimes. The conclusion situates eight degrees and varieties of citizenship and citizenship acts in the context of state-formation in world history."

Major controversy was avoided partly because China issues often were overshadowed by other policy priorities and partly because congressional Republicans feared retribution from their mercurial leader who was very popular with the party rank-and-file and often harshly punished opponents. Moreover, Donald Trump's adjustments in 2017 saw him come into line with conventional Republican congressional views on the importance of Asian allies and partners, nuclear weapons nonproliferation and greater US pressure on North Korea and on China to influence North Korea."

Abstract The impacts of nature reserves (NRs) and ecotourism on local economies are considered controversial. By surveying households residing inside and outside of six giant panda NRs in the Qinling Mountains from 2015 to 2017, this study evaluates the impacts of NRs and ecotourism on the poverty and income inequality of local communities in China. Our results suggest that the local communities of NRs show higher poverty and lower income levels compared to the national average. NRs significantly reduced the net income of households residing within the NRs, and most of these reductions are caused by converting cropland to conservation land. NRs also aggravated the income inequality of local communities, and the level of inequality inside NRs was significantly higher than that outside. In terms of the impacts from ecotourism, ecotourism can reduce poverty, but it increases income inequality, especially for those households residing within NRs."
Considering citizenship in imperial Chinese history.,"Weerdt, Hilde De",Citizenship Studies,Taylor & Francis Ltd,CITIZENSHIP; POLITICAL community; POLITICAL science -- History; CHINA; CHINA -- Politics & government; MEMBERSHIP,asymmetrical comparison; body politic; Chinese citizenship; global historiography of citizenship; political metaphor; subjecthood,"This article problematizes the meaning and use of 'citizen' and 'subject' in the global historiography of citizenship. It argues that if in pre-twentieth-century European history citizens have also been subjects, in imperial Chinese history subjects have also been citizens. This argument is laid out in three steps. The first step, which has typically been disregarded in prior discussions on the topic, establishes that membership in some form of political community was articulated through political metaphors and illustrates this on the basis of the body metaphor. Whether and how the people's membership in the polity also constitutes them as citizens is then addressed through an overview of the rules that govern the reciprocity between those groups constituting the polity and, finally, through a discussion of the types of action open to commoners to shape especially local governance."
Consigned to hedge: south-east Asia and America's 'free and open Indo-Pacific' strategy.,"Tan, See Seng",International Affairs,Oxford University Press / USA,INTERNATIONAL security; INTERNATIONAL cooperation; BALANCE of power; GREAT powers (International relations); INTERNATIONAL relations; INDO-Pacific Region; ASEAN,free and open Indo-Pacific; south-east Asia,"This article assesses how south-east Asian countries and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) have responded to the 'free and open Indo-Pacific' (FOIP) strategies promoted by the United States and the other countries in the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (the 'Quad': US, Japan, Australia and India). Their nuanced ripostes imply a persistent commitment to hedging and shifting limited alignments in the face of growing great rivalry and the lack of a clear FOIP vision among Quad members. In the face of external pressure to take sides, the ASEAN states are likely to keep hedging through working selectively with China and the United States. Given the United States' apparent preference to balance China and Trump's disregard for multilateralism, ASEAN's ability to maintain its centrality in the evolving regional architecture is in doubt—despite the Quad countries' (belated) accommodation of ASEAN in their FOIP strategies. However, the success of the US strategy depends on Washington's ability to build and sustain the requisite coalition to balance Beijing. ASEAN has undertaken efforts to enhance bilateral security collaboration with China and the United States respectively. In doing so, ASEAN is arguably seeking to informally redefine its centrality in an era of Great Power discord and its ramifications for multilateralism."

It examines Pu's years as the president and chief editor of Chenbao (1918–1922), which he transformed from a little-read partisan paper to a widely circulated and intellectually influential newspaper in Beijing. It demonstrates that Pu's cultural endeavors, which consisted of efforts at societal change through individual awakening, were geared toward his political ideal – the transformation of Chinese commoners into capable voters in a constitutional system. Despite his absence from the standard historiography, Pu left important legacies affecting life in China today."

The author constructed a One China identity scale based on national identity theory and the CPC's political advocacy and actions toward Taiwan. Using panel data from 271 members of Taiwanese student delegations to Mainland China from 2016 to 2017, this study explored the changes in their sense of a One China identity. The results showed a significant increase (0.11, 5.19%) in the average ratings of the investigated students' One China identity. The regression equation constructed by the current study was able to explain 10.94% of the total variance of the One China identity scale, and all three hypotheses were supported. Following the exchange program, Taiwanese students appeared to have a greater sense of a One China identity. Their impression of Mainland China had improved, their acceptance of the CPC's regime had increased, and their preference for authoritarianism had increased."
Constructive Engagement? The US and the AIIB.,"Freeman, Carla P.",Global Policy,Wiley-Blackwell,INTERNATIONAL economic relations; INVESTMENT banking; BETROTHAL; TRANSBOUNDARY waters,,"When the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) was launched in January 2016, 57 countries signed on to its charter. The United States was not among them. It does not appear likely that the US will change its position, particularly amid deteriorating trade relations between the US and China. However, a description of the US relationship to the AIIB that is limited to opposition and non‐membership is not adequate or accurate. This analysis takes a closer look at US interactions with the AIIB, beginning with its response to the Bank when it was announced through the time of writing in 2019. The main finding of this reexamination is that relations between the United States and the AIIB have been and remain more multifaceted than the conventional narrative portrays. Since Beijing announced plans to establish the AIIB, the United States has engaged the AIIB in ways that presented opportunities for Washington to communicate its preferences with respect to the policies and operations of the Bank. By continuing to stand outside the AIIB, and not engaging directly, Washington is arguably turning the AIIB into a symbol of US‐China competition at exactly a time when there is international clamor for greater cooperation to promote and sustain global growth."

In a 2013 article, King, Pan, and Roberts challenged this wisdom by arguing that the paramount goal of censorship is defusing collective action, not silencing dissent. After accounting for collective action potential, they argue that criticism has no bearing on censorship. In this research note, we point out that a significant portion of sampled posts in King et al.'s analysis coincided with state-led consultation campaigns that were aimed at soliciting critical public input on policy proposals. This introduces the potential for bias by combining solicited and unsolicited criticism under the generic title of criticism. After reanalyzing King et al.'s aggregate data, studying Chinese censorship directives, and offering a statistically guided thought experiment, we conclude that a more conservative version of their original thesis is in order."
Consuming missionary legacies in contemporary China: Eric Liddell and evolving interpretations of Chinese Christian history.,"Liu, Jifeng; White, Chris",China Information,"Sage Publications, Ltd.",CHRISTIANITY; CHRISTIAN historians; MISSIONARIES,Chinese Christianity; Eric Liddell; historical memories; local government; missionary,"As a significant theme running through China's modern history, Christianity's inglorious role has helped redefine the Chinese Communist Party's (CCP) self-proclaimed role as the liberator of the long-suffering nation from imperialist forces. The association between missionaries and Western imperialism has predominated the Chinese communist historiography. Nevertheless, recent years have witnessed a burgeoning movement to reinvent China's Christian past and reconstruct historical memories of stigmatized missionaries. This article suggests that local governments in China are increasingly recognizing value in the history of Chinese–missionary encounters. This is evident in how local authorities have organized and promoted commemorative activities for Scottish missionary and Olympic champion Eric Liddell (1902–45). In presenting the case of Liddell, this article reveals how the Chinese government takes the initiative in consuming historical memories of Western missionaries, and finds instrumental value in the legacy of such figures despite their religious connections."
Containment's deceit: why the United States needs to review its China strategy.,"Terhalle, Maximilian",International Politics,Palgrave Macmillan Ltd.,CONTAINMENT (Political science); CHINA-United States relations,China; Containment; Cultural superiority,"Together with many other scholars of US containment, Brooks/Wohlforth share widely held assumptions on the future US–China relationship. Indeed, their arguments tempt American strategists into foregoing evaluations as the enduring US structural superiority, reflected in the strategy of ""standing on the defensive"", reassures them that Beijing will be socialised to structural realities favouring the USA. However, China is not the Soviet Union and the twenty-first century's second decade not the 1980s. Confusing the latter with today's China and its highly adaptive governance system misrepresents a drastically changed politico-material context, as China has emerged as the leading economic power since 2014 (measured in PPP). Precisely because Brooks/Wohlforth adopt an exclusively material view, they overlook the notion of US cultural superiority which has invariably underpinned material accounts of containment. Thus, their material defence of America as ""Number One"" becomes a cognitive barrier, possibly self-defeating, to more comprehensive reviews of US technological superiority."

The China-US reconciliation and the rise of the pro-China Japanese Prime Minister Tanaka Kakuei (1972–1974) led to the normalization of China-Japan relations in 1972. The bilateral political rapport was further consolidated in the face of the common threat in the Soviet Union. With the strengthening political relations, the bilateral economic exchanges were gradually developed. Nonetheless, following the collapse of the Soviet Union, mounting Sino-US tension, China's growing assertiveness, and rising nationalism in both China and Japan, the Sino-Japanese bilateral political relations have been deteriorating. The escalating political tensions have impacted bilateral economic relations, including declining Japanese investment in China, weakening bilateral trade, and decreasing Japanese visitors to China. Despite improving bilateral political relations in recent years, it is uncertain how long these friendly gestures by the leaders of the two countries may last given several unsettled territorial and historical issues. The growing tension between the United States and China further adds uncertainty to China-Japan relations in the future. Without strong political relations, weakening economic ties cannot be easily restored."

Existing studies tend to focus on the material dimensions of the US-China rivalry. In this article I analyze the master/counternarratives produced by the two great powers that are intended to exercise their discursive power in shaping the geopolitical environment and legitimizing their global roles. Specifically, I examine the competing US and Chinese narratives on the international order and assess the impact of these narratives on shaping the values and interests of the United Kingdom. My research demonstrates that China's world order narratives have limited influence on the United Kingdom due to the fundamental differences in their political values, ideologies, and systems. Nevertheless, British leaders and policy elites are becoming more receptive to Chinese narratives, given China's growing economic power and ""disciplinary power"" to coerce other countries to accept its preferred narratives, as well as the uncertainty faced by the United Kingdom in the post-Brexit international economic environment."

Based on interviews with political elites, analysts, and academics in the United States, China, Japan, and Indonesia, we argue that the East Asian order transition is more complex and nuanced, especially when we examine views toward: (1) the Sino–U.S. rivalry for regional leadership; (2) whether Chinese initiatives such as the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and the Belt and Road Initiative disrupt the current order; and (3) the preferred vision of regional order for each of the four countries. While there is hardly a consensus view about issues of regional order, it appears that in the short to medium term, China is not expected to substantially overhaul the existing East Asian order. Nevertheless, Beijing is likely to chip away at U.S. regional leadership and, in the long term, would presumably seek to create an order that would sustain its rise and maintain its regional preponderance. The responses of other regional stakeholders toward these developments would be vital in shaping the collective impact on the East Asian order."
Contentious versus Compliant: Diversified Patterns of Shanghai Homeowners' Collective Mobilizations.,"Xie, Yue; Xie, Sirui",Journal of Contemporary China,Taylor & Francis Ltd,COLLECTIVE action; STATE capitalism; PATRIARCHY; HOMEOWNERS; COMMERCIAL real estate; CHINA -- Politics & government,,"The 1998 housing reforms in Chinese cities have played a substantial role in setting social transition in motion. Not only has it produced an urban middle class of homeowners but it has also powerfully patternized collective mobilization. Fieldwork conducted in Shanghai reveals that homeowner communities living in 'commercialized apartments' (CAs) versus 'government-sold apartments' (GSAs) undertake distinct types of collective action. CA owners contentiously defend their rights and interests, whereas GSA owners remain compliant and lobby for welfare subsidies. This distinction in collective mobilizations between homeowners seems to originate in the distinct sources of homeownership. The logic of state capitalism underlies CAs and that of socialist patriarchy underlies GSAs. Analyzing a couple of mobilization episodes, the authors, by theory of contentious politics, focus on exploring the crucial mechanisms in the process of mobilization to explain why in the different settings the similar mechanisms have produced different outcomes."

The practice is resisted by monks and the public such that the central government, which values public appearances of social justice, is pressured to support their resistance to local officials' economic demands. Using a data panel of 141 temples, we show that temples' admission fees are significantly related to the pressure that local government officials face to develop the economy. We also find that resistance to the fees exploits a factional political structure, as the monk-led movement leverages the influence of one political clique that is highly concerned with public appearances of social justice to resist the request of another. In addition, bottom-up channels such as the Internet and marketized media help the public voice its grievances, coordinate collective action, and therefore align with and mobilize the central government to override local government. The contentious view enhances our understanding of how resistance can be possible and effective, especially in an authoritarian regime."
Contesting Contested Multilateralism: Why the West Joined the Rest in Founding the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank.,"Knoerich, Jan; Urdinez, Francisco",Chinese Journal of International Politics,Oxford University Press / USA,INTERNATIONAL cooperation; ORGANIZATIONAL goals; ECONOMIC development; ASIAN Infrastructure Investment Bank; ECONOMIC conditions in China,,"This study examines why a large number of Western advanced economies joined the China-led Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) in 2015 despite the bank's purported challenge to the Western-centred international order in the area of multilateral development finance. Through a mixed-method examination involving elite interviews, analyses of government pronouncements and regressions, and by drawing on concepts from rational choice theory, international policy diffusion, and rational design of international institutions, this study finds that the AIIB's success with regard to its large membership is due to China's effective creation of a demand for the organization among Western advanced economies. We argue that policymakers in Western countries enjoyed 'induced agency', which China granted them in the process of creating the organization and deciding about its membership. First, Western advanced economies had agency because their involvement was needed to prevent the AIIB from becoming a homogenous small organization consisting of Asian debtor countries in favour of a global organization with a heterogeneous group of both debtor and creditor country members. The AIIB was thus set up to accommodate the specific economic and political goals of Western advanced economies. Secondly, Western advanced economies experienced agency in the process of deciding about their membership in the bank because China proactively courted them to join the AIIB. China moreover endorsed the spontaneous intensification of communications that ensued among Western advanced economies with regard to joining the AIIB. Both efforts ultimately resulted in diffusion among them of the decision to become members. Thirdly, the Western advanced economies were granted agency in the process of determining the AIIB's organizational design, thus allowing them to converge the initially diverse visions for the institutional design of the bank and shift it from contesting the existing system of multilateral development banks to effectively integrating into it. Our study thus advances a theory of country-specific demand for membership in an international organization."
Contesting Hegemonic Order: China in East Asia.,"Goh, Evelyn",Security Studies,Taylor & Francis Ltd,SOCIAL contract; SOCIAL structure; EAST Asia; CHINA; SOCIAL exchange,,"This paper develops an English School–informed approach to theorize hegemonic order using an explicitly social lens. It conceptualizes the architecture of hegemonic order as consisting of three social elements—compact, structure, and processes—and emphasizes social exchange, power relationships, and negotiation as the bridges linking hegemony and order. Using the most significant contemporary case of hegemonic contestation, it employs this hegemonic order framework to analyze how, and with what effects on systemic change, China is contesting the US-led hegemonic order in East Asia. It finds that variation in the forms and effects of Chinese contestation in the security, institutional, and economic domains is explained by differences in the robustness of the US hegemonic social compact, and the complexity of the regional social structure."

Researchers utilized an innovative technology that allowed the teams to harvest media content, from almost seventy-five global news sources, in Arabic, Farsi, Chinese, and Russian. This paper utilized the theoretical construct of strategic narratives to demonstrate how the U.S. election is incorporated into narrative constructions of global order. Theoretically, this project seeks to deepen our understanding, from a comparative methodology, of how ""events,"" such as the U.S. presidential election, provide the raw material for global contestations of the global order. The essay also provides a mechanism for analyzing and evaluating these narratives using Fisher's narrative paradigm. Finally, the paper demonstrates an innovative methodological approach to comparative analysis from disparate cultural and news traditions, languages, and patterns of access to media."

It can be argued that the U.S. hub‐and‐spokes model in Southeast Asia is not failing but is simply showing signs of contestation. The evolution of this network of regional security arrangements from U.S. alliances in Southeast Asia (with the Philippines and Thailand) to American security partnerships in that subregion (strategic partnership with Singapore and comprehensive partnership with Vietnam) reflects applicatory contestation. At the same time, the China factor and Washington's evolving Asia strategy, which competes with the Middle East and with the ""America First"" instincts of the Trump administration, challenge the core of the San Francisco System's validity. Hence, while the hub‐and‐spokes model is merely showing signs of contestation, the fact that it is undergoing validity contestation serves as a cautionary tale. Those U.S. policymakers supporting it will need to implement steps to avoid its complete erosion."

This paper takes an inductive approach by examining the BRI for a two-pronged purpose: first, to understand China's perception of the international order by examining Beijing's official discourse around its intentions and vision for the initiative; and, second, to examine the mechanisms through which Chinese norms are diffused and normalised in Global South states. I find that Chinese policy navigates a dialectical interchange between upholding the existing international order while simultaneously promoting alternative norms and practices to reform parts of the order that are unsatisfactory to Chinese interests. To answer the second part of the puzzle, the paper finds that a central socialisation mechanism in China's foreign policy for Global South states occurs through professionalisation training programmes. These programmes allow for Chinese expert knowledge and technical know-how to be shared with and mimicked by elites and civil servants across many Global South states."

Control Over the Security Services in Periods of Political Uncertainty: A Comparative Study of Russia and China.,"Petrov, Nikolay; Rochlitz, Michael",Russian Politics,Brill Academic Publishers,,authoritarian politics; China; political succession; Russia; security services,"Control over the security services is a key ingredient of political survival in authoritarian regimes. This is particularly true during periods of leadership succession and high political uncertainty. In this paper, we compare the strategy used by Vladimir Putin towards the siloviki – the Russian security services – with that employed by Xi Jinping towards the Chinese security services. We find that in both countries, the security services have been significantly strengthened in recent years, while at the same time extensive anti-corruption campaigns have been used to eliminate key officials within the security structures. We argue that both developments can be seen as elements of a strategy to increase control over the public, while eliminating potential competition from regime insiders, in view of a deteriorating economic situation, and the constitutional (or quasi-constitutional) term limits faced by Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping in 2024 and 2022, respectively."

Taking a cultural diplomatic initiative that sought to increase positive association for Chinese culture in the Australian public as a case study, it illustrates the range of differences that can be found amongst stakeholders, and the different roles that may be ascribed to cultural diplomacy. These interests, including those of different artistic and political stakeholders, as well as differences in the publics involved, are best segmented not only according to nation but also to subculture."
Convergence or divergence? Visions of world order and the Russian-Chinese relationship.,"Kaczmarski, Marcin",European Politics & Society,Taylor & Francis Ltd,"GLOBALIZATION; INTERNATIONAL economic relations; CHINA-Russia relations; SCHOLARS; UKRAINE Conflict, 2014-",China; global governance; Russia; Russia-China relations; world order,"Scholars studying Sino-Russian relations remain divided regarding the extent to which Russia's and China's visions of international order converge. The article addresses this question by comparing how Russian and Chinese elites interpret the evolution of world order. My analysis shows that Russian and Chinese views on world order partly overlap and partly diverge. Russia and China's defiance of Western primacy in international politics provides a basis for cooperation. Both countries distrust the West and oppose some policies pursued by the United States and its European allies. At the same time, leaders in Moscow and Beijing do not fully agree on what alternative norms they would like to promote. While joint declarations paper over this divergence, the differences are more pronounced in the patterns of Russian and Chinese practical engagement with global governance and their attitudes towards globalization and anti-globalization movements. The Chinese leadership appears to be genuinely interested in contributing to political-economic stability, while Moscow seeks first and foremost the symbolic confirmation of its great-power status and does not mind playing the role of an occasional spoiler. The article concludes that these differences have the potential to slow down, if not derail, long-term cooperation between Russia and China."

East Asia, peacekeeping operations and humanitarian assistance and disaster relief.","Jalkebro, Rikard; Jones, Catherine",Australian Journal of International Affairs,Taylor & Francis Ltd,PEACEKEEPING forces; MILITARY operations other than war; HUMANITARIAN assistance; DISASTER relief; EAST Asia,Cooperation; coordination; East Asia; humanitarian assistance and disaster relief; peacekeeping operations,"East Asia (here consisting of China, Japan, North and South Korea, and the ten states of the ASEAN) is increasingly being considered as a region which is a potential crucible for conflict. Even the most optimistic authors recognise that there is the potential for security tensions to develop into more comprehensive kinetic actions. In the context of the growing trade tensions between China and the United States, which is drawing in other regional actors, the potential for economic interdependence to mitigate these tensions is reducing. Despite the context in this region we do, however, see evidence of cooperation and coordination emerging within the arena of (so-called) non-traditional security challenges. These papers explore different aspects of the cooperation that we see, and collectively they present the conditions under which there are positive cooperation outcomes in the areas of humanitarian assistance (HA) and disaster relief (DR) and/or peacekeeping operations (PKO). Collectively, they identify that mid-range theories have great explanatory power in exploring and researching this region."
Coordinated Credit Spaces: The Globalization of Chinese Development Finance.,"Chin, Gregory T.; Gallagher, Kevin P.",Development & Change,Wiley-Blackwell,GLOBALIZATION; DEVELOPMENT banks; ASIAN Infrastructure Investment Bank; DEVELOPMENT credit corporations; BUSINESS models,,"This article examines the emergence of Chinese development finance on the global stage and evaluates the extent to which it differs from, complements and/or competes with the Western‐backed development finance institutions. Whereas the new, China‐backed multilaterals are closer to the Western model, especially the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, this analysis finds that China's national development finance is significantly distinct along three parameters — the scale and business model of Chinese finance relative to its Western counterparts, the composition and approach of China's lending portfolio, and the governance of China's development finance institutions. These differences can be seen as complements to the Western‐backed system, given that much of Chinese development finance has flowed into countries and sectors in which Western development finance institutions have ventured to a lesser extent. However, the globalization of Chinese development finance, patterned on the international diffusion of what is coined in this article as the 'coordinated credit space model', contrasts with Western development finance, governance and business models, and has triggered a competitive stance from Western actors. Either contestation or convergence are possible trajectories for the future, and the outcome will be determined by whichever can produce conditions akin to the 'politics of productivity'."

The focus will be on two interrelated developments: one, the first diplomatic mission to the Dutch Republic in 1608–1610 and, two, a scheme hatched by Siamese officials to assist the Dutch in obtaining access to the Chinese market. This was deemed necessary after the Dutch, supported by some overseas Chinese businessmen from Southeast Asia, failed to gain trading access in 1604. On the Dutch side, two men stand in the limelight: Admiral Cornelis Matelief de Jonge, a director of the Dutch East India Company (VOC) and supreme commander of its second fleet to Asia, and Hugo Grotius, who at the time was a rising star in the Dutch government and would later be celebrated as one of the pathfinders of modern international law. Both their published and unpublished manuscripts will be examined to ascertain how Matelief and the VOC directors reacted to these Siamese initiatives and how, in turn, the admiral sought to mobilize and co-opt the Siamese into his own commercial and military agenda, with the help of Grotius."

This article considers the configurations of elite networks as a key mediating factor. We argue that access to external support networks helps improve politicians' responsiveness to ordinary citizens by reducing their dependence on vested interests, and we test this claim using China's land market reform as a case. Leveraging novel city-level measures of mass grievances and political networks, we demonstrate that the intensity of land-related grievances is on average positively associated with reform occurrence, but this association is only salient among a subset of city leaders who enjoy informal connections to the higher-level authority. We also show that connected leaders tend to implement policies less congruent with local bureaucratic and business interests. These findings underscore the importance of intra-elite dynamics in shaping mass-elite interactions."
Counterterrorism and Preventive Repression: China's Changing Strategy in Xinjiang.,"Greitens, Sheena Chestnut; Lee, Myunghee; Yazici, Emir",International Security,MIT Press,COUNTERTERRORISM; NATIONAL security; MUJAHIDEEN; CHINESE Communist Party; CHINA,,"In 2017–18, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) changed its domestic security strategy in Xinjiang, escalating the use of mass detention, ideological re-education, and pressure on Uyghur diaspora networks. Commonly proposed explanations for this shift focus on domestic factors: ethnic unrest, minority policy, and regional leadership. The CCP's strategy changes in Xinjiang, however, were also likely catalyzed by changing perceptions of the threat posed by Uyghur contact with transnational Islamic militant groups in Southeast Asia and the Middle East, and a corresponding increase in perceived domestic vulnerability. This threat shifted from theoretical risk to operational reality in 2014–16, and occurred alongside a revised assessment that China's Muslim population was more vulnerable to infiltration by jihadist networks than previously believed. Belief in the need to preventively inoculate an entire population from ""infection"" by these networks explains the timing of the change in repressive strategy, shift toward collective detention, heavy use of re-education, and attention paid to the Uyghur diaspora. It therefore helps explain specific aspects of the timing and nature of the CCP's strategy changes in Xinjiang. These findings have implications for the study of the connections between counterterrorism and domestic repression, as well as for authoritarian preventive repression and Chinese security policy at home and abroad."

"""Creating Wealth"" through Debt: The West's Finance-Capitalist Road.","Hudson, Michael",World Review of Political Economy,Pluto Journals,"NATURAL resources; WEALTH; COST & standard of living; CHINA; DEBT; HOME prices; MARX, Karl, 1818-1883",Capitalism; crisis; debt; financialization; rentier,"Volumes II and III of Marx's Capital describe how debt grows exponentially, burdening the economy with carrying charges. What policies are best suited for China to avoid this neo- rentier disease while raising living standards in a fair and efficient low-cost economy? The most pressing policy challenge is to keep down the cost of housing. Rising housing prices mean larger and larger debts extracting interest out of the economy. The strongest way to prevent this is to tax away the rise in land prices, collecting the rental value for the government instead of letting it be pledged to the banks as mortgage interest. The same logic applies to public collection of natural resource and monopoly rents. The US and European business schools are part of the problem, not part of the solution. They teach the tactics of asset stripping and how to replace industrial engineering with financial engineering, as if financialization creates wealth faster than the debt burden. Having rapidly pulled ahead over the past three decades, China must remain free of rentier ideology that imagines wealth to be created by debt-leveraged inflation of real-estate and financial asset prices."

Credit risk and bond pricing of local government in China.,"Zhiling, Yang; Ronghua, Ju; Yunxiao, Xu",Public Money & Management,Taylor & Francis Ltd,GOVERNMENT securities; CREDIT risk; BOND prices; RISK premiums; REPAYMENTS,Credit risk; government bonds; local government in China; marketization,"The relationship between credit risk and the pricing of local government bonds in China is explored in this paper. The pricing of local government bonds was found to reflect credit risk, but the risk premium was small. The type of bond ('directional' or 'non-directional') significantly affected pricing. Repayment source had no effect. The authors make recommendations for the central government, local governments and investors. Our research on local government bond pricing benefits China's central government, local governments and investors. We urge the central government to strengthen its regulation of directional bonds and special bonds, and then promote marketization. Local governments should reduce the size of directional bonds, and decouple special bonds from government financial guarantees. Investors should purchase the local government bonds which have the highest premium with equal risk."

Could it be that what are no longer working as they used to and, therefore, generating most of the disaffection among citizens are the partisan channels for articulating, aggregating, deliberating and deciding among competing interests and passions?"
Critical Assessment of the Asia Rebalance.,"Professor, Nori Katagiri Associate",Chinese Journal of International Politics,Oxford University Press / USA,"HEGEMONY; AMERICAN Foreign Policy Council; CHINA-United States relations; OBAMA, Barack, 1961-; TRUMP, Donald, 1946-",,"While the Obama administration's Asia rebalance strategy received some praise from scholars and practitioners, it generated three problems that caused the USA to overlook many opportunities and neglect vital concerns. First, the strategy left Asia less stable by undermining US relations with China and smaller states in Southeast Asia. Secondly, it weakened America's influence outside Asia by committing fewer resources. Finally, the rebalance was executed out of a relatively small cadre of government officials, allowing primarily civilian agencies to dictate Asia policy and excluding key branches of government. Furthermore, although the strategy competed with the strategies of restraint and offshore balancing, it never had the solid support of any international relations theories, leaving few scholars to directly associate it with a theory. Ultimately, the rebalance's multiple logics prevented it from achieving intellectual hegemony in the American foreign policy discourse, and its substantive flaws and theoretical inconsistencies made difficult its acceptance as an enduring strategy in the Asia-Pacific region."

First, the characterization of contemporary China as a non-capitalist market economy is the most serious shortcoming of Arrighi's book. Second, Arrighi's explanation of the Industrial Revolution in relation to the increasing military requirements of the European states has solid historical foundations. Third, Arrighi makes a cogent argument that the ""Great Divergence"" of Europe and China was rooted in the relative extroversion of power struggles in Europe versus their relative introversion in China and the consequent imbalance of naval power between the two regions. Finally, Arrighi's structural analysis of hegemonic transitions in the world system enables the reader to track the links between China's economic ascent and the crisis of the U.S. hegemony. One of its most important implications is the increasing bifurcation of economic and military power in the contemporary world, signaling the immense difficulty of a single nation-state (including China) to turn itself into a world hegemon."

Most Pakistani traders in Xinjiang cannot afford to ship containers through the Khunjerab Pass and rather carry the goods purchased in China with them on the daily buses to Sost, Pakistan, thus avoiding customs duties. This form of border economy, though falling outside of the regulatory regime, is far from being informal. Rather, it is based on a network of contacts on both sides of the border and made possible by the particular institutional and infrastructural setting of the area. Based on long-term fieldwork in both Xinjiang and Pakistan, this article shows the complexity of these transactions, their transnational nature and the performativity that characterises them. It also highlights the role of online technologies and social networks in the cultivation of those relations, and the ability of traders to navigate often-changing norms and the flows that characterise the market. Eventually, the article suggests a new definition for ""the market"" as it emerges from the experience of traders in Xinjiang. For them the market is neither simply based on trust, social relations and the continuous flow of information; nor does it correspond to the global, culture-free market economy"

However, few applicable instruments are available as a baseline for profiling and estimating a community's resiliency in the face of disasters. The purpose of this study is to cross-culturally adapt and validate the original version of the 10-Item Conjoint Community Resiliency Assessment Measurement (CCRAM-10) in China. Our study further investigates if and to what extent community members translate their participation in disaster risk reduction (DRR) activities into perceived community resilience. A Chinese version of CCRAM-10 was generated and applied to 369 participants from a rural and an urban community in southwest China affected by the 2008 Wenchuan Earthquake. Internal consistency reliability and confirmatory factor analyses were performed to test the assessment instrument's applicability. The Communities Advancing Resilience Toolkit Assessment Survey was used to establish the convergent validity for the Chinese version of CCRAM-10. Multiple linear regression models were used to explore the correlations between respondents' participation in activities and their perception of community resilience, while controlling for basic socio-demographic variables. Analysis results demonstrated good internal consistency reliability (Cronbach's alpha = 0.85) and satisfactory convergent validity for the Chinese version of the CCRAM-10. Construct validity was also confirmed (χ2/df = 2.161; CFI = 0.977; GFI = 0.971; NFI = 0.958; RMSEA = 0.056; SRMR = 0.030). The regression analysis results indicated that respondents' participation in DRR activities was positively correlated with their perception of community resilience. This study contributes to the wider collection of disaster studies by providing a tested tool for assessing community resilience in the context of China. Community workers and practice researchers may be interested in applying CCRAM-10 to evaluate the effect of specific DRR programmatic activities for improving community resilience."

On the one hand, the border city of Khorgos is being rebuilt as a bridgehead to facilitate trade and development between the countries; new infrastructure and spectacle at Khorgos and beyond works to entice Kazakhs to cross the border in pursuit of economic opportunities. At the same time, recent crackdowns on Muslims in China's Xinjiang Province has led to the detention and harassment of cross-border migrants with differentiated migrant statuses. Chinese security forces' continued anxieties about separatism in its borderlands imperil the developmental horizons the BRI project uses to entice Kazakhs. It also threatens the translocal development that a border conductive to mobility has provided for Kazakhs over the past thirty years. I argue that the BRI in northwest China fuses soft power rhetoric with territorial security practices in a way that is proving to be counter-productive. This is because border hardening can reactivate borders as ""difference condensers"" that draw from imperial and national legacies to reinscribe the othering of spaces and peoples beyond the border."

This article shows that one important yet overlooked path to the development of new NGOs in Sichuan was a massive transfer of resources and personnel from other provincial governments. Pairing richer provinces with poorer ones to spur development was already a PRC practice and was immediately implemented when the earthquake struck; transferred officials with experience working with NGOs in their own provinces brought such NGOs with them, helped to create new organizations in Sichuan, and facilitated cooperation between local officials and NGO activists—a scenario neglected in earlier studies. The disaster provided an opportunity for local governments in Sichuan to learn how to outsource social service programs to cooperative NGOs, in line with recent policy elsewhere in China."

This article investigates the local meanings of halal from the perspectives of Uyghurs and Hui, who are the major Muslim ethnic minorities in China. It argues that the expressions of qingzhen and musulmanche demonstrate social concerns, anxiety of ethnic identity and ongoing intra-group competitions, which are not exclusively related to religion. The secularisation process since the qingzhen food debate has created tensions between the state and individuals of Uyghur and Hui and has embarrassed people within the same group. This tension between ethnicity and religion is largely the result of clarifying the ambiguity that bears in cultural intimacy, which originally keeps a balance between the state and its ethnic minorities."

LMS missionaries did not convert as many Chinese to Christianity as they hoped, but their auxiliary efforts were more successful. The LMS mission project facilitated the transfer of certain cultural technologies such as church councils to administer local congregations or phonetic scripts to facilitate literacy. Once in the hands of native Christians and non-Christians alike, these cultural technologies could be freely adapted for a variety of purposes and ends that often diverged from the missionaries' original intent and expectation. This article draws on the letters and reports of missionaries of the London Missionary Society in North China from roughly 1900 to 1930—the period during which self-governing Protestant congregations took root in China and many places around the world. The spread of church government structures and a culture of Bible-reading enabled Chinese within the mission sphere to create new forms of collective life. These new forms of community not only tied into local networks, but also connected to transnational flows of information, finances, and personnel. Native Christian communities embraced new, alternative sources of community authority—the power of God working through a group of ordinary people or through the biblical text—that proved both attractive and disruptive."

At its climax, thousands of protestors took to the streets to oppose a government proposal to switch local television broadcasts from Cantonese to Mandarin. Unlike other recent mass incidents in China, the ""Defend Cantonese"" protests mainly involved a place-based identity politics through which participants purported to support maintenance of Cantonese culture without explicit political and material demands. Based on the testimonies of dozens of participants and witnesses, the authors identify three sets of schematic dichotomies that framed the protests: namely, south versus north, local differences versus national uniformity, and conserving traditional Guangzhou versus urban redevelopment. It is argued that underpinning the language movement's cultural outlook was the participants' discontent with current politics and distribution of resources. The cultural packaging constitutes a specific tactic through which the actors resisted the authoritarian regime without triggering violent suppression."

Following the propositions of the balance-ofpower theory, mainly envisioned through the neorealist paradigm, there exists a discrepancy in the expected reaction of Japan and South Korea to the Chinese rise. Because of China's relative superiority in power over Japan and South Korea, the balance-of-power theory posits that the two states would pursue a strategy of external balancing by aligning themselves in order to be able to counteract the Chinese rise in power. Yet, there have been no signs of Japan and South Korea pursuing such a strategy. on the contrary, a series of disputes between the two states in the past couple of years point to Japan and South Korea getting further away from each other. By employing the neoclassical realist approach, this paper argues that historical animosity between Japan and South Korea stretching back to the early twentieth century, shaped their strategic culture in a way that is hindering Japan and South Korea to make the strategic choice to balance externally."

Although not a nutrient, caffeine is consumed by 90% of the adult population in the United States. Objective This study examined the daily pattern of caffeine intake and its relationship to multiple demographic variables. Methods Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2007–2012 (adults aged 19+ years; n=16,173) were used to determine the time of day at which caffeine is consumed and demographic factors associated with intake. Regression analyses characterized factors associated with caffeine intake including sex, age, ethnicity, education, smoking status, physical activity, employment status, total work hours, alcohol, and energy intake. Results Mean adult per capita caffeine intake was 169±4 mg/d (mean±standard error). Most caffeine (70%) was consumed before noon, often at breakfast, and intake decreased progressively over the day, with little consumed after 9:00 pm. Intake was associated with age, ethnicity, smoking status, total calorie intake, and work hours (P <0.01) but not physical activity, economic status, education level, or employment status. Variables with the largest associations with intake were, respectively, ethnicity and age. Non-Hispanic black individuals consumed the smallest amounts (80±2 mg/d), non-Hispanic white individuals consumed the greatest amounts (194±3 mg/d), and Asian individuals (126±7 mg/d) and Hispanic individuals consumed intermediate amounts (127±3 mg/d). Middle-aged individuals (aged 50 to 54 years) consumed more caffeine (211±6 mg/d) than younger (107±4 mg/d, aged 20 to 24 years) and older individuals (153±4 mg/d, aged 75 to 79 years). Conclusion Most caffeine is consumed in the morning, when alertness is lowest, and very little in the evening before sleep. Ethnicity and age were the variables most strongly associated with intake; work hours, occupation, energy and alcohol intake, and smoking were also associated with intake. Because caffeine increases alertness, it is not surprising that its pattern of consumption and factors associated with its intake vary from those of most other food constituents."

It investigates both the KMT and DPP securitization strategies under Taiwan's political and economic contexts. A de-securitizing discourse, though might have been a convincing counterargument against ECFA, was underdeveloped by the DPP members. It also shows how the debate shapes the discourse in the Sunflower Student Movements in 2014, and led to the DPP's subsequent change of securitization strategy."
Dangerous Confidence? Chinese Views on Nuclear Escalation.,"Cunningham, Fiona S.; Fravel, M. Taylor",International Security,MIT Press,NUCLEAR warfare; ESCALATION (Military science); NUCLEAR weapons; MILITARY officers; CHINA-United States relations,,"Chinese views of nuclear escalation are key to assessing the potential for nuclear escalation in a crisis or armed conflict between the United States and China, but they have not been examined systematically. A review of original Chinese-language sources and interviews with members of China's strategic community suggest that China is skeptical that nuclear escalation could be controlled once nuclear weapons are used and, thus, leaders would be restrained from pursuing even limited use. These views are reflected in China's nuclear operational doctrine (which outlines plans for retaliatory strikes only and lacks any clear plans for limited nuclear use) and its force structure (which lacks tactical nuclear weapons). The long-standing decoupling of Chinese nuclear and conventional strategy, organizational biases within China's strategic community, and the availability of space, cyber, and conventional missile weapons as alternative sources of strategic leverage best explain Chinese views toward nuclear escalation. China's confidence that a U.S.-China conflict would not escalate to the use of nuclear weapons may hamper its ability to identify nuclear escalation risks in such a scenario. Meanwhile, U.S. scholars and policymakers emphasize the risk of inadvertent escalation in a conflict with China, but they are more confident than their Chinese counterparts that the use of nuclear weapons could remain limited. When combined, these contrasting views could create pressure for a U.S.-China conflict to escalate rapidly into an unlimited nuclear war."

Many of the BRICS' (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa) dominance in export markets for low-skilled goods pose a particular challenge for ""surplus-labor"" countries characterized by large populations of unskilled and underemployed labor. We theorize the incentives of firms and governments in surplus-labor countries to form South-South preferential trade agreements (SSPTAs) as a means of diversifying and expanding trade relationships in the face of this challenge. Of all the BRICS, our findings show that China poses the greatest challenge; the countries forming the most South-South agreements are those whose exports have been most displaced by China. We verify this pattern using both systemic and country-specific measures of the China ""shock."" Imports from China, in contrast, have no significant effect on SSPTA formation. Our account, which helps resolve the dual puzzle of declining trade with rich countries and the proliferation of SSPTAs in recent decades, underlines the implications of China's rise on the developing world."
Debating Ethnic Governance in China.,"Sun, Yan",Journal of Contemporary China,Taylor & Francis Ltd,"PARTICULARISM (Political science); NATIONAL unification; IDEOLOGY; AUTONOMISM; CHINA -- Politics & government; XI, Jinping, 1953-",,"Previous scholarship has identified an emerging consensus for ethnic-policy reform in China, in the direction of strengthening national integration and a 'melting pot.' This article identifies three major contending schools in Chinese debates about the country's ethnic governance: liberal autonomists, integrationists and socialist autonomists. It argues that the socialist autonomists, who oppose the 'melting pot,' have prevailed politically. Contention among the three schools, specifically, revolves around tradeoffs between autonomy and ethnic particularism. That is, compromised autonomy but preferential policies. The liberal autonomists reject the tradeoffs because of the cost to autonomy. The integrationists reject the tradeoffs because of the divisive role of ethnic particularism. The socialist autonomists, however, embrace the tradeoffs because of the developmental and distributional benefits. With the leftward turn of the Xi Jinping regime, they have prevailed ideologically and politically to safeguard the current system from any fundamental change."

Bush and continued through the Obama administration, has largely passed, if only temporarily. To be sure, Southeast Asia is included in the Indo-Pacific framework and will figure to some extent in Washington's plans to counter China's Belt and Road Initiative, which will be partially implemented through the Better Utilization of Investment Leading to Development (BUILD) Act. The region continues to hold up one side of the conflict with China over sovereignty and island-building in the South China Sea and so can be assured of continued attention from the US Indo-Pacific Command. Apart from these broad issues and initiatives, US-Southeast Asian dynamics have returned to a status quo ante of the 1990s, when Washington was focused on geopolitical shifts in other regions, and relations with Southeast Asian nations were bilateral and spiky."

Delivered by the People's Liberation Army since 1985, this program, which aims at cultivating students' civic awareness through elementary military training, is still ongoing today. Official publications and interviews with students who attended the training suggest that defense education is successful in conveying the authority of the Party-state to China's new elite youth. The physical component of the training is the added value that is well received by the new generations, by comparison with ideological indoctrination. The Chinese Communist Party's use of the military to infuse discipline and compliance among a historically volatile section of society highlights the militarist nature of the People's Republic of China."

Deliberative participatory budgeting: A case study of Zeguo Town in China.,"He, Baogang",Public Administration & Development,Wiley-Blackwell,BUDGET; COMMUNITY involvement; SOCIAL structure; SOCIAL science methodology; EMPIRICAL research; CHINA,China; civic engagement; deliberative participatory budgeting; deliberative polling; participatory budgeting; political participation,"Summary: The search for a better practice instrument of civic engagement has led to participatory budgeting and deliberative polling in recent years. Participatory budgeting stresses empowerment and citizens' struggle against the establishment and unequal social structures, whereas deliberative polling works within the system and focuses on improving democratic decision‐making processes by applying credible social science methods. Often, these two processes are presented as being in conflict with each other, which is to the detriment of the search for best practice in deliberative governance. This paper develops a theoretical analysis of deliberative participatory budgeting which is distinguished from unrepresentative and non‐deliberative but self‐selected participatory budgeting; that is, it considers how the quality of participatory budgeting can be improved through deliberative polling. This theoretical analysis is backed by an empirical study of deliberative participatory budgeting in Zeguo Township, Zhejiang Province, China. It explores whether, how, and under what conditions it is possible to combine deliberative polling and participatory budgeting. It details four experiments and assesses the successes, failures, limitations, and problems of the experiments. The case of Zeguo offers scholars, activists, and officials lessons about how to pursue best deliberative practice in both authoritarian states and democratic societies."

The study suggests that while Western leverage might have been influential in the democratic development of observed hybrid regimes, it could have been counterbalanced by the presence of alternative Chinese foreign assistance."
Demographic Engineering and International Conflict: Evidence from China and the Former USSR.,"McNamee, Lachlan; Zhang, Anna",International Organization,Cambridge University Press,"BORDERLANDS; LAND settlement -- Government policy; ETHNIC groups -- Government policy; INTERNATIONAL conflict; CHINA -- Foreign relations -- Soviet Union; CHINESE history, 1949-1976; HISTORY of the Soviet Union, 1953-1985",,"When and where do states coercively alter their internal demography? We build a theory that predicts under what conditions states alter the demographic ""facts on the ground"" by resettling and expelling ethno-national populations. We predict that, under particular scope conditions, states will employ demographic engineering to shore up control over (1) nonnatural frontiers, and (2) areas populated by ethnic minorities who are co-ethnics with elites in a hostile power. We then substantiate our predictions using new subnational data from both China and the USSR. Causally identifying the spatially differential effect of international conflict on demographic engineering via a difference-in-differences design, we find that the Sino-Soviet split (1959–1982) led to a disproportionate increase in the expulsion of ethnic Russians and resettlement of ethnic Han in Chinese border areas lacking a natural border with the USSR, and that resettlement was targeted at areas populated by ethnic Russians. On the Soviet side, we similarly find that the Sino-Soviet split led to a significant increase in expulsion of Chinese and the resettlement of Russians in border areas, and that resettlement was targeted at areas populated by more Chinese. We develop the nascent field of political demography by advancing our theoretical and empirical understanding of when, where , and to whom states seek to effect demographic change. By demonstrating that both ethnic group concentration and dispersion across borders are endogenous to international conflict, our results complicate a large and influential literature linking ethnic demography to conflict."

Adjusting for common control variables, our estimates show that local cadre density has a significantly positive effect on regional economic performance. This result holds when we employ the local cadre density in 1949, when the Chinese Communist Party assumed power, to instrument for the current local cadre density. We also tested the channels through which local cadres play a role in regional economic development. Our empirical results show that a high local cadre density has a significant effect on attracting economic resources, which promotes regional economic performance."
"Depoliticization, Politicization, and Criminalization: How China Has Been Handling Political Prisoners since 1980s.","Fong, Ware",Journal of Chinese Political Science,Springer Nature,POLITICAL prisoners; COURTS; POLITICAL stability; CHINESE Communist Party; CHINA; CHINA -- Politics & government; AUTOREGRESSIVE models; AUTOREGRESSION (Statistics),China; Criminalization; Depoliticization; Political prisoners; Politicization,"By exploring the CECC's political prisoner database and employing three ARDL times series models and two OLS models, the paper finds that China's party-state has been dealing with political cases through depoliticization, politicization, and criminalization within and without the judiciary. The author argues that these strategies employed by China's party-state are a function of China's modernization, domestic conflicts, and the urgency to sustain political stability. Unlike what happened in the Western history where depoliticization was usually followed with democratization, China's depoliticization has been strategically utilized to justify the Party's rule over China mainly through its judicial system. China's politicization, as a fundamental political strategy, has been often applied to handle those political threats such as Falun Gong practitioners and political/civil rights fighters, who are unable to be publicly criminalized and trialed but can be penalized with covert judicial and/or extra-judicial means by the Chinese government."

Recently, scholars have suggested that the design and features of specific online platforms shape what is politically expressed online and how. Building on these findings and drawing on 112 semi-structured qualitative interviews with information technology experts and internet users, we explain how major Chinese social media platforms differ in structure and motivation. Drawing upon a nationwide representative survey and an online experiment, we find that platforms aiming to make users a source of information through public, information-centred communication, such as the Twitter-like Weibo, are more conducive to political expression; while platforms built to optimize building social connections through private, user-centred communication, such as WhatsApp and Facebook-like WeChat, tend to inhibit political expression. These technological design effects are stronger when users believe the authoritarian state tolerates discussion, but less important when political talk is sensitive. The findings contribute to the debate on the political consequences of the internet by specifying technological and political conditions."
Destination China: International Students in Chengdu.,"Lu, Zheng; Li, Wei; Li, Mingming; Chen, Yixuan",International Migration,Wiley-Blackwell,FOREIGN students; FACTOR analysis; EDUCATION -- China; STUDENT surveys; EDUCATIONAL quality; NONPARAMETRIC statistics,,"Based on a survey of 355 international students studying at seven universities in Chengdu, China, this article analyses the reasons for their choosing to study in China. The main methods employed are factor analysis and associated nonparametric tests. Results reveal that the quality of Chinese education and Chinese specialities are the most important reasons. In addition, personal referral sources, tuition and living costs, bilateral relations between China and home countries, and policy incentives at the destination, are also important. There are differences between students from developing and developed countries. Students from developing countries placed more emphasis on the quality of Chinese education, suggestions from relatives/friends, and geographic proximity. Those from developed countries referred more frequently to costs and policy incentives. Students who chose courses focusing on Chinese culture, society and language tended to be attracted by human interest, while students who chose courses on other subjects paid more attention to the quality and content of the teaching."
Destined for Misperception? Status Dilemma and the Early Origin of US-China Antagonism.,"Wang, William Ziyuan",Journal of Chinese Political Science,Springer Nature,INTERNATIONAL relations; DILEMMA; INTERNATIONAL security; POWER (Social sciences); BALANCE of power; CHINA-United States relations,Core interests; Misperceptions; Status dilemma; US-China relations,"Why did the US-China relations take a turn for worse around 2010 despite the bilateral efforts to forge a cooperative framework? Concerned about the danger of conflicts in the course of power transition—namely, the ""Thucydides Trap""—in US-China relations, scholars tend to see either a security dilemma at play or an intensification of status competition between an emerging power and the established hegemon. While recognizing the explanatory leverage of the security-dilemma framework and the status-competition model with regard to the continued deterioration of the US-China relations up to Trump, this article asserts that both models fall short in addressing the early origin of the deterioration of US-China relations. The concept ""status dilemma"" promises to fill the analytic gap thereby left. The status dilemma suggests an inability of two states to grasp the status claims signaled from the other side. Misperceptions associated with status dilemmas fall outside of the purview of the security-dilemma framework, and could lead to the emergence of zero-sum competitions for status. Such misperceptions are apt to occur in a situation of power transition whereby status recognition tends to have geostrategic implications for the great powers involved. This article illustrates this logic of status dilemma via the US-China diplomacy over the ""core interests."" This investigation promises crucial insights into the analogy of the Thucydides Trap to US-China relations."
Determinants shaping the international currency system: Where do currencies stand relative to their equilibria?,"Siranova, Maria; Rocha, Manuel Duarte",World Economy,Wiley-Blackwell,INTERNATIONAL finance; HARD currencies; DETERMINANTS (Mathematics),dollar; emerging market economies; euro; international currency; international monetary system; renminbi,"Using a sample of 27 currencies, we empirically test the role of a large set of determinants potentially underlying currencies' share in the international currency system, providing, to the best of our knowledge, the most comprehensive study of this kind so far. We propose a new global indicator that quantifies the international use of currencies on the basis of three dimensions—medium of exchange, unit of account and store of value. From a range of indicators including openness, financial development and institutional development indicators, we uncover several variables that are significant in explaining the international status of currencies, hence contributing to understanding the role of the determinants shaping the international currency system. We also investigate the long‐run equilibrium values for currency shares, allowing us to score currencies on the basis of the potential stemming from the determinants. We contribute to the debate on international currencies' prospects, not only by looking at much discussed currencies such as the US dollar, the euro and the Chinese renminbi, but also by uncovering potential of emerging currencies. This knowledge is of the utmost importance for the debate on the reform of the international monetary system—from the point of view of academics, policymakers and market practitioners."
Development and divergent post-disaster trajectories in a mountain village: Temporal dynamics of differentiation after the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake.,"Fayazi, Mahmood; Yeh, Emily T.; Li, Fan",World Development,Elsevier B.V.,"DISASTER relief; VILLAGES; WENCHUAN Earthquake, China, 2008; HOUSING; CHINA; CHINA -- Politics & government -- 2002-",Asia; China; Differentiation; Disaster recovery; Experiences of development; Reconstruction,"• We found differentiation in long-term household recovery and experiences of development after the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake. • In a mountain village in Pengzhou, in-situ self-reconstruction was viewed more positively than concentrated settlement. • Households in concentrated settlements experience challenges of income generation and adequate living space. • Changing housing and guesthouse construction policies and regulations exacerbated existing inequalities. • Secondary earthquake hazards and expropriation of rural house lots created new inequalities. Following the massive and devastating 2008 Wenchuan Earthquake, the Chinese state called for major reconstruction to be completed within three years. Reconstruction was subsequently folded into longer-term development goals, an approach often considered 'building back better.' However, few studies have examined long-term trajectories of household recovery following the earthquake and reconstruction-as-development. We conducted a case study of long-term trajectories in a mountain village in Pengzhou City, Chengdu Municipality, which was severely impacted by the earthquake. Based on in-depth qualitative methods, including semi-structured interviews conducted with 59 villagers and local leaders between September 2018 and May 2019, we analyze a variety of distinct post-earthquake trajectories, including different patterns of recovery and experiences of development for villagers in a concentrated settlement and those who chose owner-driven reconstruction on their pre-earthquake house lots. We find that concentrated settlement created significant barriers to income generation and problems of inadequate housing to accommodate demographic growth and family reproduction. For those who chose in-situ reconstruction, differentiation happened over a span of a decade, as a result of changing development visions and construction regulations, as well as secondary earthquake hazards. These processes have both exacerbated existing inequalities in a small, relatively homogenous village, and created new ones. Some households experience the post-earthquake period as an acceleration of development, whereas others experience a sense of moving backwards in time to a less-developed status. Our study demonstrates that earthquake recovery cannot be considered a single, discrete event, but must instead be understood through long-term trajectories that intersect with both political processes and place-based events. Moreover, we show how qualitative, in-depth studies can shed light on processes otherwise obscured when earthquake recovery and development are conceptualized as apolitical, technical problems."

However, to date, there is no broadly accepted scale or questionnaire for assessing preschoolers' caregivers' feeding behavior in China. To develop a scale that can be used to assess preschoolers' caregivers' feeding behavior in China and to conduct a preliminary evaluation of the scale's reliability, validity, and discriminative ability. The scale was created through a literature review and qualitative interviews with the target population. Items were reviewed by 50 caregivers of preschoolers and 10 experienced pediatricians, and 95 items were selected to form a draft scale. The draft scale underwent three rounds of investigation, and the results from these evaluations were used to select items that formed the final scale. Three groups of caregivers (n=175, 400, and 912) were sampled and stratified from urban and suburban kindergartens in the cities of Jinan and Xi'an between March 2016 and October 2017 to participate in evaluations of the draft scale. From these caregiver groups, 146, 362, and 768 participants completed valid questionnaires, respectively, which were used in the scale's evaluation. The general demographic data of the participants and scores of each item in the scale were the primary outcome measures. Exploratory factor analysis and variability analysis were used to evaluate the draft scale, based on data from two rounds of investigation. The structure of the scale was explored through confirmatory factor analysis, and its reliability, construct validity, and discriminative ability were evaluated based on data from a third round of investigation. The Chinese Preschoolers' Caregivers' Feeding Behavior Scale (CPCFBS) consisted of 35 items and seven dimensions; the total cumulative variance contribution rate was 58.6%; the Cronbach's α coefficient was.91; the split-half reliability coefficient was 0.89; and the test–retest reliability coefficient was 0.85. The age and weight status of the children and the caregivers' age and education levels, as well as family incomes and child-caregiver relationships, were correlated with feeding behavior. The CPCFBS appeared to have good reliability and construct validity in specific Chinese populations. Future studies are needed to confirm existing findings in different Chinese populations with larger sample sizes."

Initial prediction equations to estimate adiposity are complex, requiring skinfold measurements that cannot be obtained conveniently by the general population. To develop simplified prediction equations to estimate body fat percentage (%BF) in Asian Chinese adults, evaluate the validity of the simplified %BF prediction equations, compare the simplified %BF prediction equations with an existing equation, and create visual charts to enable easy assessment of adiposity by the general public. Simplified prediction equations were developed and evaluated for validity using anthropometric measurements obtained from a cross-sectional study. Healthy participants with no major diseases and not taking long-term medications were recruited in a cross-sectional study conducted at Clinical Nutrition Research Centre, Singapore, between June 2014 and October 2017. A total of 439 participants were used for model building (269 women and 170 men) and another 107 participants were used for evaluating validity (62 women and 45 men). Simplified but acceptable prediction models and generation of user-friendly charts. Simplified sex-specific %BF prediction equations were developed using stepwise regression and the model-building dataset. The best models were selected using the Akaike information criterion. The models were further simplified and their performance was compared using the validation dataset before choosing the final prediction equations. The final selected models for women and men included waist circumference and height with nonsignificant prediction bias in %BF of 0.84%±3.94% (P =0.098, Cohen's d z =0.21) and –0.98%±3.65% (P =0.079, Cohen's d z =0.27), respectively. The final equations were split into three height categories from which the sex-specific prediction charts were generated. The sex-specific prediction charts provide a good visual guide for estimating %BF using height and waist circumference values that are easy to obtain by the general public."

Regarding combat readiness, the research question outlined in this paper relates to whether the General Staff experimented with mission-command - a key component of Russia's modern military thinking. The answer is clearly no: operational creative manoeuvring hardly featured during the VOSTOK-2018 drills for clearly identified reasons. At the systemic level, little room was left for initiatives since the drills focused on implementing and testing command and control (C2) systems. At the structural level, VOSTOK-2018 was not oriented towards mission-command but 'mission-control' and streamlining centralised decision-making processes down to the tactical level. At the symbolic level, free play was not exercised due to the participation of China in the drills, and the necessity to impress Chinese military observers."

Graham Allison has recently coined the term ""Thucydides' Trap"" to emphasize how structural forces are leading to instability in U.S.-China relations. This interpretation of history is inaccurate and reflects the influence of misleading translations. Drawing on the original Greek text of Thucydides' History of the Peloponnesian War, I argue that the concept of Thucydides' Trap does not find support even in the case that has given it its name. Thucydides' famous attribution of the war to ""the growth of the power of Athens"" actually refers to the expansion of the Athenian Empire rather than a shift in the distribution of capabilities. Structural arguments do offer valuable insights about potential sources of conflict in U.S.-China relations, but the causal mechanism has little to do with the analogy of Athens and Sparta. As exemplified by the flashpoint in the Strait of Taiwan, structural change has aggravated long-standing differences between the United States and the PRC. Beijing's growing economic and military power has resulted in a growing threat to Taipei, which has led the United States to affirm its commitment to Taiwan's security in ways that are inconsistent with the One-China policy. If this trend continues, it will raise the potential for a military confrontation between the great powers in East Asia."

Clear understanding of flood responses in regions with different levels and expansions of urbanization is of great importance for regional urban planning. In this study, comparison of flooding responses to urbanization processes in terms of flood peak and runoff volume in the upper, middle, and lower Xiang River Basin (XRB), China, was carried out using the Hydrologic Engineering Center-Hydrologic Modeling System (HEC-HMS) model. From 2005 to 2015, urbanization level and intensity were higher in the lower XRB compared to the upper and middle XRB, and the overall expansion rate of urban areas was 112.8%. Modeling results by the HEC-HMS model indicate elevated flood peak discharges and volumes due to fast urbanization in the XRB from the 1980s to 2015. This rapid increase is particularly the case in the lower XRB. The study also revealed different hydrological responses of flood regimes—urbanization tends to have larger impacts on peak flood flow rather than on flood volume in the lower XRB, which further corroborated urbanization-induced intensifying flood processes in terms of peak flood flow. Urbanization has increasing impacts on flood volume from the upper to the lower XRB, which can be attributed to accumulated runoff down the river system. This study provides a reference for basin-wide land use and urban planning as well as flood hazard mitigation."

Two recently published books, both of which cover the ""romance"" between Russia and China, make notable attempts to replace the old framework. McGuire's personal and transnational history represents an overt and ambitious challenge to the existing studies. Lukin's more traditional international relations work revisits a simple realist account by trying to understand the mindset of policymakers in both countries.

This study explores the relationship between administrative centralization and the adoption of local marketization innovation in China. In the central–provincial–city hierarchical structure of China, political interactions across different levels of governments significantly influence the marketization reform process. We argue that, although the intervention policies from the central or provincial governments independently stimulate the city adoption of marketization innovation, their combined impact on city governments tend to be competitive rather than complementary. We empirically examine the diffusion of probusiness administrative licensing centers across Chinese cities between 1997 and 2012. Statistical findings supported by robustness checks confirm our theoretical hypotheses."
Digital China: A Fourth Industrial Revolution with Chinese Characteristics?,"Ito, Asei",Asia-Pacific Review,Taylor & Francis Ltd,CHINA; SOUTHEAST Asia; INDUSTRY 4.0; HAZARDOUS occupations; PRIVATE companies; RURAL geography,,"This paper examines both the universal features and unique aspects of China's digitalization process. The impact of digitalization, domestically and in other Asian countries, is also explored. China's digital economy has grown rapidly since the end of the first decade of the 21st century, and compared to other countries with similar levels of economic development, China has a high rate of use of digital services. China's digitalization process is driven by both private companies and by the state's strategic initiatives, including social governance. China faces both opportunities and risks from digitalization. Workers in rural areas as well as older workers may face a higher risk of job loss through automation in the future. Chinese IT companies are eager to expand their activities both domestically and in foreign countries, and their investments in so-called ""unicorn"" companies in Southeast Asia are especially noteworthy."
Digital Representation in an Electoral Campaign Influenced by Mainland China: The 2017 Hong Kong Chief Executive Election.,"CHAN, FUNG; SUN, BIYANG",Issues & Studies,World Scientific Publishing Company,ELECTIONS; SUFFRAGE; POLITICAL development; INFORMATION technology; SOCIAL media,Chief Executive Election; information and communication technologies; Mainland authorities' policy toward Hong Kong; political marketing; universal suffrage,"Widely known by the public, the Chief Executive of Hong Kong is selected not by universal suffrage but by a 1,200-member Election Committee (EC). While candidates Carrie Lam, John Tsang, and Kwok-hing Woo all ran in the Chief Executive Election of 2017, only Lam received the blessing of authorities in the Mainland. Though Tsang had led the polls throughout the entire campaign and was popular on several social media platforms, a majority of EC members still cast their vote for Lam as Chief Executive. This was the first time that EC members voted against popular opinion in the Chief Executive Election. This paper analyzes the limited power of social media under elections that are under the influence of Mainland China. It also examines the problem of legitimacy in such electoral settings and the way in which authorities in the Mainland have influenced electoral outcomes through defects in the institutional systems of Hong Kong. The 2017 Chief Executive Election affirmed the tightened control of Mainland authorities over the affairs of Hong Kong."
"Disability, technology innovation and social development in China and Australia.","Goggin, Gerard; Yu, Haiqing; Fisher, Karen R; Li, Bingqin",Journal of Asian Public Policy,Taylor & Francis Ltd,,Australia social policy; China social policy; digital economy; Disability; innovation; social development; technology,"This paper examines the turn to technology innovation in disability policy, as it has manifested in the accessibility and digital inclusion agendas in China and Australia. It provides a review of the disability policy changes and related initiatives in both countries to offer insights for broader discussions of digital technology innovation and social policy in Asia. We argue that while governments take pivotal roles in formulating and implementing digital disability policies, people with disabilities apply their own agency to take advantage of market opportunities through economic participation in digital economy. The state responds positively to the agency of people with disabilities in social development and participation by opening opportunities for research grants, start-up funds, publicities and policy lobbying. It is here we see the hope in such a collaborative and mutually constitutive approach to innovative social policies that aim at inclusive and sustainable growth - something that deserves concerted, comparative research and evaluation by policy scholars."
"Disaggregating China's local political budget cycles: ""Righting"" the U.","Vortherms, Samantha A.",World Development,Elsevier B.V.,BUDGET; GOVERNMENT spending policy; ECONOMIC policy; PUBLIC welfare; SOCIAL security; REFORMS; CITIES & towns; CHINA; 1949-; CYCLES,China; Political budget cycles; Welfare spending,"Highlights • Welfare spending varies both across time and space in Chinese municipalities. • National reforms increased incentives for welfare spending for local leaders. • Welfare spending increased when local leader promotion is not likely. • Political budget cycles are more dynamic in Western provinces. Abstract What impact does spending time horizon have on political budget cycles? While traditional political budget cycles increase visible spending with immediate gains before political turnover, I hypothesize that spending in categories with less-immediate gains categories increases when opportunity costs are lower. In this article, I build on existing literature on budget cycles in both democracies and non-democracies to disaggregate types of budget cycles: those with long-run versus short-run benefits. In China, after central-level reforms, welfare targets, with long-run gains, became visible to local leaders' constituents, the central leaders above them. Local leaders then had an incentive to provide welfare, but only when it was the least costly in terms of opportunity costs. Using fixed-effects models panel data from China's 333 municipalities for 1994–2012, I find welfare spending minimizes both relatively and absolutely around year three, and maximizes at the beginning and end of a politician's tenure, when opportunity costs and probability of political advancement are lowest. These cycles are the most dramatic in western provinces, where education is a particularly important tool for ideological spread. Health and Social Security spending also see expansion at the end of mayor's tenures, although the cycles are less pronounced than in education spending. This study expands the literature on political budget cycles by disaggregating government spending and considering the impact of timeliness on cycles."
"Disaster relief, international status and regional order: a case study of Typhoon Haiyan.","Salmons, Richard","Global Change, Peace & Security",Taylor & Francis Ltd,"DISASTER relief; EMERGENCY management; HUMANITARIAN assistance; INTERNATIONAL cooperation; SUPER Typhoon Haiyan, 2013; TYPHOONS",disaster relief; East Asia; hierarchy; Humanitarian assistance; regional security; status,"International military cooperation in disaster relief has become a useful illustration of Asia-Pacific regional order building in action. This is because contemporary Asia-Pacific order-building involves constant renegotiation of the existing regional hierarchy, so that states engaging in disaster relief are also competing for international standing. We should expect that disaster cooperation establishes standing because it lets these states at once demonstrate material power, establish practical international ties, and build legitimacy. These are each key building-blocks of international order. A case study of the contributions of Japan and China in response to Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines in 2013 shows disaster responses mirroring patterns of status-seeking that have been highlighted in recent IR literature. Japan's disaster contribution may have clarified and strengthened its role as a security partner in South-East Asia, while China has since worked to raise its profile as a provider of international humanitarian assistance."
Discerning states' revisionist and status-quo orientations: Comparing China and the US.,"Chan, Steve; Hu, Weixing; He, Kai",European Journal of International Relations,"Sage Publications, Ltd.",INTERNATIONAL agencies; INTERNATIONAL cooperation; TREATIES; REVISIONIST Zionism; CHINA-United States relations,International order; power-transition theory; revisionism; status-quo orientation,"International Relations literature often refers to states' motivations as revisionist or status-quo oriented. Such attributions are especially prevalent in discourse on the power-transition theory, suggesting that the danger of war rises when a revisionist China catches up to a status-quo US. Such attributions, however, are rarely supported by systematic evidence providing a direct comparison of Chinese and US conduct. We undertake an analysis of how these countries have behaved differently over time according to their policy pronouncements, their participation in international institutions and agreements, and their voting in the United Nations. Our analysis challenges the conventional wisdom that a rising power tends to be revisionist whereas an incumbent hegemon is invariably committed to the defense of the international order."
Disciplined love: the Chinese Communist Party's wartime restrictions on cadre love and marriage.,"HUANG, Daoxuan",Journal of Modern Chinese History,Taylor & Francis Ltd,,"""28-5-regimental cadres""; cadres; Chinese Communist Party (CCP); marriage; Party spirit","During the Chinese War of Resistance against Japanese Aggression and the Civil War, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) imposed restrictions on the marriage of its cadres, so as to maintain the Party's effective control and combat cohesion. The Central Committee of the CCP did not issue uniform regulations on this topic; most decisions were made by the base areas, with the indirect support of the Central Committee. Marriage and love are personal matters, and the restrictions certainly caused emotional suffering for ordinary cadres affected. However, there were important reasons for the CCP's implementation of these measures. Through punishment and guidance, these restrictions were carried out smoothly and did not cause great upheaval. As love and marriage became areas subject to the political power of the CCP, they unexpectedly became a focal point of the collision between individuality and Party spirit and between the individual and the group."
Discourses of rivalry or rivalry of discourses: discursive strategies and framing of Chinese and Japanese foreign policies in Central Asia.,"Dadabaev, Timur",Pacific Review,Taylor & Francis Ltd,FOREIGN relations administration; WORLD politics; POLITICAL science; CENTRAL Asia; CHINA-Japan relations,Central Asia; China; Japan; OBOR; Silk Road,"This article analyzes discursive strategies of China and Japan to integrate newly emerging Central Asian (CA) states into their internal and external policies, norms and concepts, according to which they justify both their actions in CA and CA responses to these policies. This article elaborates the concept that to a certain extent, the interests of China and Japan in CA are similarly focused on mineral resources and political stability. However, these countries employ different discursive strategies to frame their approaches and goals. This article also emphasizes that the discourse of competition for regional domination prevalent in the English language, Russian and some CA media is largely an imposition of a zero-sum vision of international relations that is not proven by any empirical evidence. On the contrary, many of the projects conducted both by China and Japan are compatible – if not supplementary – and do not necessarily imply exclusivity of interest. At the same time, both China and Japan have different ways of reasoning their CA engagements, resulting in a rivalry of discourses for the 'hearts and minds' of the CA population."
"Disparities in Subjective Wellbeing: Political Status, Urban-Rural Divide, and Cohort Dynamics in China.","Zhang, Tony Huiquan; Hu, Jing; Zhang, Xichao",Chinese Sociological Review,Taylor & Francis Ltd,SOCIAL surveys; CENTRAL economic planning; COHORT analysis; CAPITALISM; TRANSITION economies; CHINA; CHINESE Communist Party; CITY dwellers,,"This paper investigates disparities in subjective wellbeing in China by analyzing the Chinese General Social Survey (2003–2015). Our hierarchical age-period-cohort models reveal how Chinese Communist Party membership, the urban-rural divide, and cohort differences have jointly shaped levels of happiness. Interestingly, the significance of political status in shaping happiness varies profoundly across birth cohorts and locations of residence. In earlier cohorts (1910–1948), Communist Party members in rural areas have a considerable advantage over nonmembers, but this advantage gradually diminishes later, except the 1977–1985 cohort. The advantage of urban party membership keeps increasing up to the cohort born during 1957–1965 but declines rapidly after that. Findings suggest that in the planned economy, political status plays a central role in promoting subjective wellbeing especially in urban China; the transition to a market economy in post-Mao China has reduced political disparities among younger cohorts, mainly for urban residents."

In recent years, many infrastructure and connectivity (I&C) programs have been launched in the Indo-Pacific, designed to close the 'infrastructure gaps' that plague the region. Competition amongst these, particularly between US and Chinese offerings, has posed a dilemma for Australian foreign policy. Australia has struggled to articulate a policy on China's Belt and Road Initiative that balances strategic concerns against economic opportunities; while enthusiastic engagement with US alternatives risks perceptions of 'choosing' sides between the region's two main powers. Yet the contemporary marketplace for Indo-Pacific I&C is much broader, with programs recently launched by many governments and regional organisations. These presents an opportunity for Australia to diversify its infrastructure diplomacy, particularly through engagement with the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, cooperation with Japan and new avenues for commercial diplomacy. By engaging with a wider range of I&C partners and institutions, Australia can better integrate itself with the emerging infrastructure systems of the Indo-Pacific."

This study investigates the impact of ""intergenerational value change"" on impressions of China in 2017 among three political birth cohorts of Taiwanese. Based on a representative survey of Taiwanese citizens, the study finds that cohort impressions can be classified according to the extent to which they relate to the economic–political and the social–environmental dimensions, suggesting that Taiwanese perceptions of China are not unidimensional and are more nuanced than they first appear. The data by and large confirm the validity of cohort differences; members of the first and oldest cohort hold more positive impressions of China with respect to social and environmental issues than members of the second and middle cohort, while the third and youngest cohort would regard China in a more positive light if their economic and political concerns were addressed. A few variables remain statistically significant, including party identification and unification versus independence preference, even after controlling for aging effects."

Several say that this ""productivist"" strategy is much less determined by the concepts of citizenship, legal, social rights, and much more regarding building functions. The purpose of this study is to examine whether the welfare and social policy ideas that characterize Chinese aid in Africa are influencing traditional donors and becoming global. The article utilised a qualitative study that has two main components. First, a comprehensive content analysis of over 50 key Sino-African, Chinese and Western policy documents from 2000 (since cooperation between Beijing and African countries first became institutionalised). Second, there were semi-structured interviews with Chinese, African and Western stakeholders in Addis Ababa, (Ethiopia), who was directly involved in the relationship between China and Africa and related development issues. The result of documentation and interview analyses show that there are currently significant differences between Chinese and Western approaches. China has made much stronger and more explicit links between development aid and economic activity than most Western donors. The aid is usually implemented through specific projects rather than broader programs or policies."
Does cross-Strait tourism induce peace? Evidence from survey data on Chinese tourists and non-tourists.,"Pan, Hsin-Hsin; Wu, Wen-Chin; Chang, Yu-Tzung",International Relations of the Asia-Pacific,Oxford University Press / USA,PEACE; TAIWAN; CHINA; TOURISTS; TOURISM; PATIENTS' attitudes; TOURIST attitudes; INTERPERSONAL confrontation; GROUP tours,,"Recent studies revisit the debate over whether tourism promotes peace via intergroup contacts. In this article, we examine the case of China-Taiwan confrontation and argue that the increase of Chinese tourists visiting Taiwan contributes to peace across the Taiwan Strait. Specifically, the touristic experiences and interactions with Taiwanese improve Chinese people's understanding of Taiwan, fostering a patient and peaceful attitude toward the prospect of cross-Strait relations. With the survey data collected during July and September 2013, we find that Chinese people who were visiting Taiwan for the first time were less likely to support a rapid pace to the unification between China and Taiwan or unification by force than those who had never visited Taiwan. Additionally, the attitude is stronger among independent tourists than those who came in escorted tour groups. Our findings suggest that contacts between tourists and locals are effective in alleviating political tension across the Taiwan Strait."
Does foreign investment liberalisation enhance women's economic status?

The identification exploits the substantial relaxation of foreign investment regulations immediately after China's accession to the WTO in 2002. The difference‐in‐differences estimation results show that FDI liberalisation has improved women's economic status significantly by increasing female earnings in sectors more exposed to FDI. Further analyses indicate that foreign investment liberalisation facilitates the promotion of female employees in their career ladders and increases their skill premium, which are two important channels through which women enhance their economic independence."

We study whether and how China's engagement in the GVC enhances firms' wage by using firm‐level and customs transaction‐level data covering the period 2000–06 with the methods of propensity score matching (PSM), difference in differences (DID) and generalised propensity score (GPS). The empirical results show that first, GVC engagement can improve firms' wage. Second, the improvement effect is more prominent in capital‐intensive and foreign‐invested enterprises. Third, the degree of embedment in the GVC shows a U‐shaped relationship with wages (the marginal improvement changes from decreasing to increasing). Finally, by analysing the mechanism, we find that participation in the GVC ultimately improves the overall wage level of enterprises through the productivity effect and the reallocation effect of labour demand."

We obtain evidence for structural shifts and non-linearity in the stock prices of the military industry in the Chinese stock market. Because sharp shifts and structural breaks are taken into account, the unit root hypothesis for most listed companies is rejected. Our result suggests that the Chinese military market is inefficient because of such factors as defense reforms, friction in the stock market, and irrational investors. We provide investment implications to enable future stock price movements to be predicted based on past behavior and enable trading strategies to be developed to earn abnormal returns. Meanwhile, Chinese defense enterprises should continue to implement industrial reforms, change their bureaucratic culture, and develop a market-oriented workforce."

These reports come from many of the countries that the U.S. has strong trade deals with such as Laos, China and Vietnam. This research seeks to answer the question: ""Is the U.S. supporting unfair labor practices through trading with these countries?"" This work looks at the effect that the number of trade agreements, trade openness and multilateral versus bilateral agreements had on number of labor standards and laws in Laos, China and Vietnam. This essay used the U.S. State Department's Report on Human Rights to measure the number of laws and violations each country had. Through this research the author determined that the number and types of trade that a country engages in effects how their country creates laws and how likely they are to report and do something about violations."
Domestic Instability as a Key Factor Shaping China's Decision to Enter the Korean War.,"Daekwon, Son",China Journal,University of Chicago Press,"POLITICAL opposition; INTERVENTION (Federal government); CHINESE Communist Party; KOREAN War, 1950-1953; ARCHIVAL materials",,"This study explores the domestic determinants of China's intervention in the Korean War. Since the war, scholars have produced a large number of studies on the motivations behind China's intervention in the war. These previous studies paid scant attention to domestic aspects, all of them assuming, albeit implicitly, that Party leaders could readily harness all available domestic resources and devote them to their political ends and that the public was willing to sacrifice their material resources and lives in order to satisfy the leaders' political goals. By contrast, this study, based on extensive newly unearthed archival documents, argues that very unfavorable domestic circumstances helped shape the CCP's strategy both before and after the outbreak of the Korean War. The domestic challenges not only provided the rationale for the CCP's opposition to Kim Il-Sung's Korean War plan before June 1950 but also gave an internal impetus for China's vacillation in decision making and affected Mao's final proactive decision to enter the war in October 1950."
Domestic politics of Chinese foreign policy: where will Xi Jinping bring China?,"Takeuchi, Hiroki",Asian Security,Taylor & Francis Ltd,"VALUE chains; MANUFACTURING industries; XI, Jinping, 1953-",,"Xi Jinping has concentrated his power since he acceded to the Chinese presidency. Where will Xi bring China? In this review essay I discuss four single-authored books – one in English and three in Japanese – to explore security implications of Xi's reform and foreign policies. In her recent book, Elizabeth Economy is critical of Xi, arguing that he is turning away from Deng Xiaoping's reform and internationalist policies. The three Japanese China specialists concur, and further highlight the interconnectedness of domestic politics and international relations. In sum, the four books show that Xi has struggled to commit to the state-owned enterprise reform and to cooperative foreign policy due to Chinese domestic politics, and as a result, has threatened regional security in the Asia-Pacific."
Domestic Sources of the US Trade War with China.,"STANGARONE, Troy",East Asian Policy,World Scientific Publishing Company,INTERNATIONAL trade disputes; ECONOMIC impact; CHINA,,"The origins of the US–China trade war predate the Trump administration's aggressive stance and have their roots in the economic impact of China's entry into the WTO and China's economic practices. The recently concluded phase one deal provides each side a chance to cool the tensions, but the politics in the United States likely preclude a full resolution in the near term. Another consequence of the trade war is the acceleration of production shifts out of China to Southeast Asia, but these opportunities are accompanied by greater US scrutiny of trade with the region."
Donald Trump and the Evolving U.S.-Russia Relationship.,"KOROBKOV, Andrei",Perceptions: Journal of International Affairs,Republic of Turkey Ministry of Foreign Affairs Center for Strategic Research,,Eurocentric system; Global North; power politics; U.S-Russia relations; unimultipolar system,"Donald Trump came to the White House with a desire to adjust U.S. foreign policy to the ongoing shifts in the international system. As a hardcore realist, he wanted to improve U.S.-Russia relations, perceiving the latter as an important counterweight to quickly-growing China and a potential partner in dealing with religious fundamentalism. Nevertheless, of all Trump's policy initiatives, this one has encountered the most resistance from entrenched American elites. Combined with massive propaganda campaign alleging Russian interference in the U.S. elections (that seems to target Trump no less than Russia), the President's opponents are pursuing an agenda that will have long-term consequences for both countries. The elite's refusal to recognize the scale and the potential consequences of the ongoing world power shifts and the consistent exaggeration of both the RF's power capabilities and the seriousness of its threat to Western interests create a distorted virtual reality, handicapping the Global North's ability to deal with newly emerging threats. These policies incrementally push Russia toward China, strengthen the hawks within Putin's inner circle, and lead to further conservative shifts in his foreign and domestic policies."

In our conclusion, we reflect on the evolution of DAC engagement in Brazil, China, India, and South Africa (BASIC countries) and what it might mean for all official donors. Our assessment is that the changing geopolitical environment for development cooperation is once again privileging economic diplomacy concerns within DAC donors, propelling specific kinds of decisions about the choice of instruments, sectors, and modalities in BASIC countries. It would appear that the administrative practice of foreign aid is increasingly derived from changes within the institutional environment for international development."

With a large number of floating population flooding into Beijing in recent years, the demographic structure of its neighborhoods becomes increasingly diversified, which is likely to cause some latent social instabilities. Consequently, more and more residents' committees are authorized to establish community work stations to underpin the function of grassroots governance and shift administrative responsibilities from superior governments. Since urban neighborhoods in China are actually an acquaintance society in the ""differential mode of association (H ffj& fi)"", the self-enforcement and self-governance of community work station depends on acquaintanceship and interaction between local residents, residents' committees and community work stations. This article intends to explore the operation of grassroots self-governance by a case of Panjiayuan Neighborhood in Chaoyang District of Beijing. The empirical study based on mixed methods of qualitative interview and quantitative survey has revealed that community work stations led by resident's committees is an arena of self-governance and its operational mechanism is driven by social capital under the mediator of community network, within which social capital will be accumulated and proliferated in the neighborhood, and resident's motivation for voluntary cooperation will be intensified as well."

It argues that geographic contiguity further exacerbates rivalry between two rising regional powers. As geographically contiguous regional powers attempt to build regional security frameworks as a step toward possible hegemony, they are bound to encounter conflicting interests. Due to the overwhelming decline of violent conquest and the extensive cost of undertaking war with another rising regional power, competing powers resort to soft balancing approaches in trying to constrain the rival's strategic space. The Sino‐Indian relationship is used as a case study given their geographic contiguity, status as rising powers, and rivalrous bilateral relationship."

The region is a key node in the Chinese project ""One Belt, One Road,"" with Chinese economic and political presence most prominent in Kenya, Zambia and Zimbabwe. Kenya, as an apparent geopolitical point of tension, is the main state stronghold for China in the region. At the same time, it maintained its attachment to the Western Block in the course of the Cold War even since its independence. In neighbouring Somalia, the United States influence is most marked, with presence through military operations and NGOs. States in the East Africa region are attempting to gain 'the best of two worlds', between Chinese expansionism and the continued enticement of US economic power. The paper explores how identities are shaped or influenced by major international economic realignments. It asks, what are the responses in the states of the region to the newly established circumstances and potential for (re)colonization of the economy and the mind in an era of indeterminacy."

It further demonstrates that there was no Sino-East German rapprochement during Matern's visit, but quite the contrary –relations between the two countries actually deteriorated, resulting in the East German delegation failing to achieve their goals. Yet, Soviet miscalculation and misunderstanding of China's policy led them to substantially increase their economic assistance to East Germany, so as to 'win their German comrades back' to the Soviet side."

China's successful experience with e-commerce has had a positive effect in transforming consumer-goods sectors of the economy and motivating economic reform. This article looks at how e-commerce reduces barriers to entry and enables firms to move up the value chain by using the global value chain framework to analyse the impact of e-commerce on the upgrading trajectories and governance structures of China's apparel industry. For large Chinese brands, e-commerce has enabled end-market diversification. For small- and medium-sized enterprises, e-commerce has facilitated entry with functional upgrading as well as end-market upgrading. In the ""two-sided markets"" created by platform companies, the ""engaged consumers"" are the demand side of this market, and ""e-commerce focused apparel firms"" are the supply side of the new market. Consumers and platforms are more directly involved in value creation within this emerging internet-based structure."
Economic containment as a strategy of Great Power competition.,"Kim, Dong Jung",International Affairs,Oxford University Press / USA,GREAT powers (International relations); INTERNATIONAL competition; COMMERCIAL policy; INTERNATIONAL economic relations; FOREIGN trade regulation; CHINA-United States relations,China; Cold War; grand strategy; Great Powers; International Relations theory; US foreign policy,"Economic containment has garnered repeated attention in the discourse about the United States' response to China. Yet, the attributes of economic containment as a distinct strategy of Great Power competition remain unclear. Moreover, the conditions under which a leading power can employ economic containment against a challenging power remain theoretically unelaborated. This article first suggests that economic containment refers to the use of economic policies to weaken the targeted state's material capacity to start military aggression, rather than to influence the competitor's behaviour over a specific issue. Then, this article suggests that economic containment becomes a viable option when the leading power has the ability to inflict more losses on the challenging power through economic restrictions, and this ability is largely determined by the availability of alternative economic partners. When the leading power cannot effectively inflict more losses on the challenging power due to the presence of alternative economic partners, it is better off avoiding economic containment. The author substantiates these arguments through case-studies of the United States' responses to the Soviet Union during the Cold War. The article concludes by examining the nature of the United States' recent economic restrictions against China."
Economic Statecraft and the Making of Bilateral Relationships: Canada-China and New Zealand-China Interactions Compared.,"Noakes, Stephen; Burton, Charles",Journal of Chinese Political Science,Springer Nature,MIDDLE powers; INTERNATIONAL relations; CHINA -- Foreign relations; CANADA -- Foreign relations; NEW Zealand -- Foreign relations; CHINA-United States relations,Canada; China; Economic statecraft; Foreign policy; New Zealand,"Conventional wisdom would suggest that middle powers, being hyper-attuned to great power politics, can be expected to bandwagon with their traditional allies. In a unipolar world, Canada and New Zealand could thus be expected to play follow-the-leader with the US. However, the rise of China has a confounding effect on the US-led unipolar order and thus on our traditional expectations of American middle power allies as well. In this article, we probe the apparent variation in what we term ""strategic value"" for China of New Zealand and Canada. While the two hold a great deal in common, we find that the Canadian case is made considerably more complicated by both the range of strategic considerations present, and the potential payoff for China of one in particular—closeness to the US, China's prime geostrategic rival. These higher stakes in the Canadian case not only make strategic inroads in New Zealand relatively easy for China, but also suggest that Chinese economic policy is selectively sculpted to suit the PRC's higher strategic purposes."

China's geostrategic and security motivations are said to be behind its spearheading of the AIIB. This essay highlights that China's national and international security calculations have evolved in the period after the Bank's opening. In the initial phase of the AIIB's formation, 2013–2017, the Bank's creation was part of Beijing's pursuit of a more outwardly ambitious and bold national/international security agenda of new institution‐building, looking to reshape the system of global governance. But since 2017, China's leadership has responded to sustained international pushback against its ambitious agenda, especially but not exclusively from the United States, and it has refocused its national security priorities onto protecting national economic growth, national sovereignty and regime preservation. Beijing has supported moves to put some distance between the AIIB and the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), and Chinese strategists have shifted to seeing the AIIB as helpful for mitigating an economic downturn across Eurasia, and preserving China's continuing growth and regime survival in what they perceive as a period of external threat. Future research on China's conduct inside existing multilateral bodies, and its formation of the AIIB as a new multilateral organization, should assess Beijing's behavior through the theoretical framework of ontological security calculations as well as material power."

In this article, we study the case of Ecuador, focusing on Rafael Correa's administration (2007–2016), as a way to delve into these issues. As conventional wisdom about the power of economics suggests, we find that Ecuador's foreign and domestic policies have inclined towards China and Chinese companies. However, this was not solely because of China's economic allure. Ecuador's stance also has something to do with the fact that better ties with China and receptivity to Chinese foreign direct investment (FDI) flows fit the government's international economic and political agenda. Moreover, they also conformed to the social agenda of Ecuadorian leaders, which made it even more logical to pursue warm ties with Beijing and create an open door for Chinese outward FDI (OFDI). As for Correa specifically, his regime sought to bring in Chinese OFDI as a means to promote a new growth model as well as his development philosophy Buen Vivir."

Education and Childrearing Decision-Making in East Asia.,"Hu, Shu; Yeung, Wei-Jun Jean",Chinese Sociological Review,Taylor & Francis Ltd,DECISION making; HUMAN capital; INTERNATIONAL Social Survey Programme; CHILD rearing; EDUCATION -- China,,"Previous research on household labor has focused more on its physical participation and less on the mental and managerial responsibility. In this paper, using data from the 2006 East Asia Social Survey and the 2012 International Social Survey Program, we evaluate how couples made childrearing decisions and the role of relative education in shaping such decisions in urban China, Taiwan, and Japan. We find a dominant ""co-pilot"" model of childrearing decision-making among the urban Chinese with both husbands and wives participating, a ""separate sphere"" model among the Japanese with least sole decision-making by the husband, and a mixed model among the Taiwanese. Regardless of gender, the better-educated parent in China and Taiwan is more likely to take sole charge of childrearing decision-making. This suggests that the human capital of parents may play an increasingly salient role in parenting behavior in contemporary East Asia in the sense that the better-educated parent has a greater responsibility for making childrearing decisions while the gender boundaries become more blurred over time."
Effects of the preference for environmental quality on the export competition between China and OECD countries.,"La, Jung Joo",World Economy,Wiley-Blackwell,ENVIRONMENTAL economics; EXPORTS; ECONOMIC competition; CROWDING out (Economics); COMMERCE; OECD countries; CHINA,China's crowding‐out effect; China's dampening effect; preference for environmental quality,"This study examines how importers' preferences for environmentally friendly products influence the effect of China's export growth on the exports of OECD countries to third markets. The effect of China's export growth is systematically investigated using the theoretical gravity model, which assumes that importers' environmental preferences are heterogeneous among countries. A new measure is also proposed to represent importers' revealed preferences for environmental quality across countries. Panel data consisting of observations for 30 OECD exporting countries and 60 importing countries over the 2000–10 period confirm that the crowding‐out effect of China's export growth on the exports of OECD countries observed in markets for consumption goods and the dampening effect observed in markets for intermediate goods are becoming weaker as the importer preference for environmental quality becomes stronger."

Through a close analysis of the writing of foreign-policy elites in South Korea from 2013 to 2017, the study finds that OBOR was generally depicted as significant to China’s re-emergence in regional and global affairs, but not as wholly detrimental to South Korean interests. Elites did not speak with one voice, but presented the government with a comparatively sanguine view of OBOR. The debate, we illustrate, created unlikely alliances between left- and right-leaning elites about some aspects of the initiative, but it also revealed tensions among conservative and centrist elites. In seeking to demonstrate their relevance to policy makers, however, elites inadvertently underlined their growing distance from the general public."

It has been argued that depoliticised NGOs in China 'embedded' in existing political structures would eventually bring about democratic changes through incremental actions, as they did in post-Soviet Russia. Both countries, however, recently witnessed the shrinking of political and legal space for public participation, especially for foreign-funded civil society organisations. This article analyses the impact of the NGO laws on civil society in Russia and China to update the embedded activism hypothesis. It draws on empirical data to describe the strategies that the NGOs use to adapt and how the future of the sector is perceived by young people in both countries."

Beginning in the late 1950s, Mao began to broadcast the idea that he was a keen swimmer and to convince the masses to take up swimming. The swim was the climax of those efforts and an integral part of the Mao cult. Swimming in Mao's China offers a useful lens for understanding the close relationship between sports, the body, and politics. Swimming was a means for Mao to mobilize mass support for his political authority and a venue for the masses to practise and perform Maoism. This article examines the constructive process and meanings of Mao's swimming body, and the extent to which the bodies of the populace were regulated through the mass-swimming craze. Drawing on untapped archival materials related to mass swimming in Mao's China, this article argues that swimming both solidified and destabilized the Mao cult and became a venue through which political values were shaped, indoctrinated, contested, and repudiated."
Embracing complexity: a framework for exploring governance resources.,"Stoker, Gerry",Journal of Chinese Governance,Taylor & Francis Ltd,INTERNATIONAL relations; AUTHORITARIANISM; CORPORATE governance; INDUSTRIAL management; TECHNOLOGICAL innovations,adaptive systems; Complexity; failure; governance,"The premise of this article is that when comparing governance systems, a greater focus on the complexity of the environment facing nation states would provide a step forward. National regimes should not be compared in a vacuum but rather with respect to the governance challenges they are likely to face in an unpredictable world. It is necessary to recognize the adaptive complexity of the systems generating those challenges and yet how they also providing the ingredients for emergent solutions. It is argued that exploring interactive capacity rather than formal structures will provide a stronger indication of whether governance challenges are likely to be met. It is concluded that different types of national regimes could, in principle, deliver effective interactive governance capacity in different ways, but each can generate tipping points that could lead to failure."
Empirical evidence on surrogate country method for non‐market economy: US anti‐dumping policy towards China.,"Kim, Hyerim; Ahn, Dukgeun",World Economy,Wiley-Blackwell,CONFLICT management; INTERNATIONAL trade; DISPUTE resolution (Law); COUNTRIES; EVIDENCE; CHINA; WORLD Trade Organization,anti-dumping; non‐market economy; surrogate country method,"Whether the non‐market economy (NME) treatment on China can be maintained even after the expiry date under Section 15 of China's World Trade Organization (WTO) Accession Protocol is one of the most controversial issues in the WTO. In fact, the key issue of the NME status in the anti‐dumping (AD) proceedings turns out to be how surrogate countries are selected in relation to dumping margin calculation. This paper reviews the US practices concerning the application of the surrogate country method. Despite the general perception of capricious and random selection of surrogate countries, the Department of Commerce has maintained a consistent pattern for applying the criteria. This seemingly consistent practice, however, raised systematic problems—but not at a significant scale—in dumping margin calculation concerning Chinese products. This result sheds an interesting light on the current WTO disputes concerning the China's NME status. At least in terms of the US AD practices, the result of the WTO dispute settlement process may not have a significant impact on the China's exportation."
Emulating or integrating? Modern transformations of Chinese higher education.,"Yang, Rui",Journal of Asian Public Policy,Taylor & Francis Ltd,,Confucianism; higher learning traditions; imperial examination; Taixue; the academies; University,"Western models of the university have fundamentally shaped Chinese universities over the twentieth century. Since the nineteenth century, bringing together aspects of the Chinese and Western philosophical heritages in higher education has turned out to be an arduous task. The striking differences between the two value systems have led to cultural tensions. Chinese universities have not figured out how to wed the standard norms of Western higher education with their traditions. The Western concept of a university has been taken only for its practicality. Chinese higher learning traditions have had strong impact on contemporary higher education development. While China's history of the educational institutions called university today is long and their changes have been drastic, the transformation of China's higher education has been surprisingly little documented in the English literature. Without a good grasp of the nature of Chinese traditional higher education and institutions, it is almost impossible to truly understand modern Chinese higher education. Tracing the historical roots of Chinese higher education, this article examines how traditional Chinese higher education and its institutions have been transformed under the influence of their Western counterparts. It attempts to capture the interactions between indigenous Chinese and imported Western traditions in higher education."

However, in 2016 and 2017, Chinese courts, in two unprecedented moves, recognized and enforced commercial monetary judgments rendered in Singapore and the United States, based on the principle of reciprocity. This Article scrutinizes this promising development with a comparative study of the laws concerning JRE in the United States, European Union, United Kingdom, Australia and Hong Kong. More importantly, it analyzes prospective challenges and proposes four solutions: (i) reconciling JRE under a treaty and JRE according to reciprocity; (ii) transitioning from de facto reciprocity to de jure reciprocity; (in) determining requirements for JRE according to reciprocity; and (iv) adding defenses against JRE according to reciprocity. This is a timely effort to help develop the Chinese JRE system in the context of the ""One Belt One Road"" initiative. Additionally, this Article also has broad international implications for other jurisdictions contemplating JRE, as it discusses the controversial values, contents, and practical regime required to realize JRE according to reciprocity."

However, profound interdependence continues underpinning the bilateral relationship. Neither the US nor China can afford to disengage from the other.

This study proposes a new mechanism—citizen's engagement of a profit-seeking broker—that helps to facilitate state-society bargaining, resolve conflicts and thereby absorb social contention. This form of state-society bargaining is conducted via professional brokers whose objective is to make a profit from the transactions. By establishing trust between the officials and citizen, the broker brings the two parties together, enables and facilitates state-society bargaining that would not have taken place otherwise. In so doing, the broker helps to resolve conflicts or protracted stand-offs that might have spilled into street protest. These profit-seekers represent commodification of state-society bargaining by matching demands from discontented citizens with supplies of special favours by state officials. This study contributes to the growing body of conflict resolution and state repression literature in China."

High-level visits between Bangladesh and India and the resolution of some of the long pending issues have removed some earlier distrust, greatly institutionalizing the relationship between the two. India opposes the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), while Bangladesh is a participant. China shares a robust relationship with the military of Bangladesh, while security cooperation between India and Bangladesh is nascent, involving capacity building and cooperation to meet non-traditional security challenges. Bangladesh has kept the sensitivities of the two countries in mind as it engages with both. Therefore, it has built its energy and infrastructure with the largest credit line ever offered by India while also engaging with China to invest massively in infrastructure projects. Bangladesh is the only country in South Asia to have profited from relations with both India and China in such a way. In this study, four sectors have been selected in which Bangladesh has engaged both countries and benefitted immeasurably."

Environmental Concern in China: A Multilevel Analysis.,"Hao, Feng; Song, Lijun",Chinese Sociological Review,Taylor & Francis Ltd,ENVIRONMENTAL degradation; POLLUTION; ECONOMIC impact; CHINA; STRUCTURAL equation modeling,,"Existing cross-national studies have identified that country-level economic and environmental factors can affect environmental concern at the individual-level. However, we know little in regard to how these contextual factors and their interaction with individual-level factors shape environmental concern within countries. Using China as an example, we examine three hypotheses: the affluence hypothesis, the degradation hypothesis, and the need contingency hypothesis. We measure environmental concern in three dimensions using twelve indicators. The latent mean comparison and multilevel structural equation modeling results show that provincial economic development and environmental degradation as well as their interactions with individual social-economic status have significant impacts on one's environmental concern. Such impacts vary by the dimension of environmental concern. People from provinces with better economic conditions generally have higher environmental concern, especially for the perceived dangerousness of pollution and environmental behavior dimensions. The degradation hypothesis receives mixed support that depends on the measure of environmental degradation. Theoretical and methodological contributions as well as policy implications are discussed."
Environmental Determinants of Chinese Development Finance in Africa.,"Gellers, Joshua C.; Jeffords, Chris",Journal of Environment & Development,Sage Publications Inc.,STATISTICAL hypothesis testing; INTERNATIONAL economic assistance; ENVIRONMENTAL quality; AFRICA; CHINA; DETERMINANTS (Mathematics); CHINESE investments,Africa; China; development; environmental regulation; foreign investment,"To what extent are decisions regarding Chinese investment in Africa motivated by environmental factors? A considerable body of work has examined the determinants of foreign aid among traditional donors, producing useful debates about the relative significance of recipient need or merit and donor interest. But far less scholarly effort has focused on the motivations of emerging donors and the role of environmental factors in influencing aid allocation. In an attempt to fill these gaps, this article uses statistical techniques to test the hypothesis that China deliberately invests in African countries with poor environmental performance for reasons related to recipient need or donor interest. Drawing upon project-level data regarding investments made by China in Africa from 2002 to 2012, the analysis suggests that Chinese development assistance grows commensurate with a country's environmental performance, but only to a point. After a state achieves a certain level of environmental quality, Chinese investments decline."
E-representation: the case of blogging people's Congress deputies in China.,"Shpakovskaya, Anna",Journal of Chinese Governance,Taylor & Francis Ltd,REPRESENTATIVE government; BLOGS; CHINA; INFORMATION & communication technologies; SOCIAL media,Chinese cyberspace; E-representation; people's Congress deputies; representative claims,"In this exploratory study I join the ongoing research on digitalization of political representation. In the literature on the use of the new information and communication technologies (ICTs) by the parliamentary and congress members in the Western countries, it is often argued that online engagement has the potential to improve the quality of political representation by means of more direct and individualized communication between representatives and represented. Following the scholarly research on digitalization of political representation in the Western countries, I ask how people's congress deputies in China appropriate social media for representative communication. I first define political representation in terms of interest expression. I then apply Michael Saward's representative claim-making perspective and analyse the content of interactions between people's congress deputies and netizens in the Weibo microblogging sphere in the period between 2013 and 2018. To identify, analyse and categorize online claims, I propose the concept of e-representation, operationalized in terms of individualization, everydayness, interactivity and connectivity. The analysis of online blogging is further complemented by semi-structured interviews with acting and former PC deputies of national and provincial congresses, popular Weibo bloggers (so-called Big V) and academic experts conducted in China throughout 2018–2019. The presented analysis provides empirical evidence from China that also has several theoretical implications. First, it tests Saward's model by revealing the predominance of incomplete claims. Second, it also shows that claims on representation and misrepresentation are in abundance compared to claims of representation, which are rare. The Chinese case may thus contribute to a more refined typology of representative claims."

Ethnic Conflicts in Hillside Borderlands. A study on headhunting in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century Taiwan.,"HUNG, LI-WAN",Modern Asian Studies,Cambridge University Press,ETHNIC conflict; BORDERLANDS; ETHNIC relations; CHINESE; LOCAL history; MANNERS & customs,,"This article examines ethnic conflicts in hillside borderlands, with special emphasis on the tradition of headhunting. Moreover, this study investigates how the self-autonomous new settlers negotiated with the aboriginal tribes to establish their living space, as well as the social relationships that were formed as a result. The findings of this study reveal, on the one hand, the multiple meanings of the headhunting custom and its evolution following the influx of new settlers and under Qing statecraft, and, on the other hand, shed light on how immigrants established their living space in the face of complex ethnic relationships and conflicts in the hillside borderlands. Although the practice of headhunting did not have its roots in conflicts between mountain inhabitants (shengfan) and plains immigrants (shufan and Han Chinese), changes in the nature and scale of headhunting in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries were the result of the mass influx of new settlers and state intervention. In borderland regions where government authority was not well established, immigrants were left to fend for themselves and were much affected by the local cultural environment. Hence, when analysing the development of immigrant society or local history, due attention should be paid to the social traditions and characteristics of native inhabitants, which often provided the background and underlying reasons for ethnic conflicts."

There is a high migration rate of ethnic Chinese people to Western countries, and those women present a high-risk group for GDM. Little is known about diet, dietary self-management, and nutritional supplementation use among ethnic Chinese migrant women with GDM compared with members of the host population with GDM. This study aimed to compare the perceptions and experiences of dietary self-management and nutritional needs of ethnic Chinese migrants with those of Australian-born white women with GDM in Australia. A predominantly qualitative mixed methods approach with a quantitative component was used. Data collection involved in-depth, semistructured interviews, and 3-day 24-hour recall diaries collected concurrently. Data analysis and management relied on NVivo (QSR International Pty Ltd), FoodWorks (FoodWorks Professional 2017, Xyris Software), and SPSS (SPSS Inc). Pearson χ2 test, independent-samples t test, and Mann-Whitney U test were used to compare nutrient intakes between groups. The Pearson correlation was used to determine the relationship between dietary patterns and nutrient intake. A total of 44 ethnic Chinese and 39 Australian-born white participants with GDM were recruited from two large Australian maternity services located in tertiary hospitals. Ethnic differences in satisfaction with GDM education influenced GDM self-management. Ethnic Chinese women with GDM perceived dietary advice received from health professionals to be lacking in cultural relevance and detail and responded by restricting their dietary intake and relying on nutritional supplementation. The perceived benefits of specific supplements produced ethnic differences in the patterns of supplement use. Cultural dietary patterns influenced dietary adequacy in pregnancy. This study suggests the need for provision of more concrete, prescriptive, and culturally relevant dietary and supplementation advice for ethnic Chinese women with GDM."
Ethnic minority empowerment and marginalization: Yi labour migrants outside China's Autonomous Regions.,Xinrong Ma,China Information,"Sage Publications, Ltd.",MINORITIES; SOCIAL marginality; CHINESE autonomous regions,collective dispute; labour migrants; patronage; preference policies; stability maintenance; Yi ethnic minority (Nuosu),"While there is an emerging body of literature that examines labour resistance within industrial cities in China, there is, however, little research on ethnic minority labour migrants, in particular their interaction with the local state in migrant-receiving cities. This study fills this research gap by focusing on ethnic Yi labour migrants in the Pearl River Delta area. Based on seven and a half months of fieldwork, this article illustrates the ways in which local governments cope with Yi labour disputes on the one hand, and the strategies that Yi migrants developed - emphasizing their minority status while negotiating their labour rights - on the other. The article finds that a strategy to maintain stability by applying patronage selectively to certain ethnic groups cultivates ethnic elites as middlemen to appease workers' collective disputes in the short term. However, the state's failure to fully recognize cultural differences of ethnic minorities and to protect their labour rights results in more resistance and marginalization of ethnic minority labourers in the long term. In this way, the Chinese government's current policy may jeopardize the wider aim of maintaining social order."
"Ethnicity, Gender, and Oil: Comparative Dynamics in the Ecuadorian Amazon.","Vallejo, Ivette; Cielo, Cristina; García, Fernando",Latin American Perspectives,Sage Publications Inc.,POLITICAL ecology; GENDER identity,Amazonia; Ethnic identities; Gender; Neoextractivism; Petroleum,"During the past decade, Ecuador's Alianza PAÍS socialist government, primarily under the leadership of Rafael Correa, was committed to moving toward a post-neoliberal economy and implementing a ""New Amazon"" free of poverty, with expanded infrastructure and services, as part of the redistribution of oil revenues. However, in sites of state development projects, gender hierarchies and territorial dispossession in fact became more acute. Analysis of two place-based indigenous political ecologies—one in the central Amazon, where the state licensed new oil blocks in Sapara territory to a Chinese company in 2016, and the other in the Kichwa community of Playas de Cuyabeno in the northern Amazon, where the state company PetroAmazonas has operated since the 1970s—shows how women have reconfigured their ethnic and gender identities in relation to oil companies and the state in the context of rising and falling oil prices and in doing so reinforced or challenged male leaders' positions in the internal structures of their communities and organizations.Durante la última década, el gobierno socialista de Alianza PAÍS de Ecuador, principalmente bajo el liderazgo de Rafael Correa, se comprometió a avanzar hacia una economía posneoliberal e implementar una ""Nueva Amazonía"" libre de pobreza, con infraestructura y servicios ampliados, como parte de la redistribución de los ingresos petroleros. Sin embargo, en los sitios de proyectos estatales de desarrollo, las jerarquías de género y el despojo territorial de hecho se hicieron más agudos. Análisis de dos ecologías políticas indígenas basadas en el lugar—una en la Amazonía central, donde el estado otorgó licencias de nuevos bloques petroleros en el territorio de Sapara a una compañía china en 2016, y la otra en la comunidad Kichwa de Playas de Cuyabeno, en el norte de la Amazonía, donde la compañía estatal PetroAmazonas ha operado desde la década de 1970—muestra cómo las mujeres han reconfigurado sus identidades étnicas y de género en relación con las compañías petroleras y el estado en el contexto del alza y la caída de los precios del petróleo y, al hacerlo, refuerzan o desafían las posiciones de los líderes masculinos en la estructura interna de sus comunidades y organizaciones."
EU-China Security Relations: Discourse vs Practice and the Role of EU Member States.,"Montesano, Francesco Saverio",International Spectator,Taylor & Francis Ltd,CHINA; EUROPEAN Union -- Foreign relations; EUROPEAN Union membership,China; cooperation; EU member states; European Union; security,"The gap between discourse and practice which has so far prevented the EU and China from implementing the ambitious security agenda developed within the framework of their strategic partnership is caused by two main sets of impeding factors: practical, stemming from existing policies, and normative, deriving from fundamental divergences regarding the nature of an actor's role in the international arena. Moreover, obstacles to EU-China security cooperation also stem from and are magnified at the EU member states level. Key member states lack normative and practical synergy in their understanding of security policy and the role the EU and China play in it, thus severely complicating any attempt at bridging the discourse/practice gap."

It notes the trend towards the progressive formation of this broad integration grouping on a continental scale and, based on a politico-economic understanding of the essence of the new bloc, determines its current composition, which mainly includes member countries of the Eurasian Economic Union and member and observer countries of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization. The author considers the conceptual views of geopoliticians and geographers on the role and place of continental Eurasia in the world and examines the main prerequisites and difficulties of Eurasian continental integration. The study reveals a common geographical feature of the countries included in Greater Eurasia: the unique ultra-continental position of their inland regions, located, globally speaking, at the greatest distance from economical sea routes and major world markets. A case study of the Central Asian countries, Russia's Siberia, and the western regions of China shows the negative impact of the ultra-continentality factor as manifested in increased transport costs, which creates serious barriers to economic growth and foreign trade activity. It is suggested that accelerated creation of latitudinal and meridional international transport corridors is a promising way to achieve greater economic consolidation of the inland regions of Greater Eurasia. The study highlights the new opportunities for the economic development of Russia's ultra-continental macroregions offered by Eurasian continental integration."
Eurasian Land Bridge: linking regional value chains along the New Silk Road.,"Pomfret, Richard","Cambridge Journal of Regions, Economy & Society",Oxford University Press / USA,INFRASTRUCTURE (Economics); ECONOMIC development; ROADS -- China; BELTWAYS; EUROPE -- Foreign relations,Belt and Road Initiative; trade costs,"This article argues that the establishment of the China–Europe Land Bridge predated the announcement of China's One Belt One Road (Belt and Road Initiative) and has been market-driven, as service providers identified and responded to demand for efficient freight services along pre-existing railway lines. Governments' role was trade facilitating, that is reducing delays and costs at border crossing points, rather than investing in hard infrastructure. Service providers responded by linking European and Asian value chains (for example in automobiles and electronic goods) and reducing costs for traders shipping between China and Europe. In sum, market forces were the catalyst for the rail links between China and Europe that are often analysed in the context of China's economic rise and Chinese international relations."

European responses to these disputes have pulled in three directions: a normative approach emphasising the resolution of disputes within the framework of international law; a power balancing approach, led by France and the United Kingdom, involving support for freedom of navigation operations and strengthened bilateral and EU ties with other Asian states; and de facto acquiescence to Chinese advances in the region. In terms of understanding EU foreign policy, this case suggests a sequence: a normative approach as the initial default EU policy; a turn to power balancing when the effectiveness of that policy is called into question, but also the possibility of acquiescence and consequent divisions amongst EU member states. Europe faces dilemmas in balancing support for the United States, Japan and the South-East Asian states with its strategic partnership with China, but in practice European policy is much closer to that of the former group than that of Beijing."

European Migrant Professionals in Chinese Global Cities: A Diversified Labour Market Integration.,"Camenisch, Aldina; Suter, Brigitte",International Migration,Wiley-Blackwell,FOREIGN workers; LABOR market; NONCITIZENS; IMMIGRANTS; PROFESSIONAL employees; CHINA; SOCIAL conditions,,"Since the early 2000s, Chinese metropolises have been emerging as hubs for the national and global economy. They attract increasing numbers of foreigners with diverse socio‐economic and educational backgrounds who tend to immigrate independently of the Chinese initiatives focused on ""foreign talents"". Our analysis contributes to the understanding of these migrants' integration into the labour market. Through a Bourdieusian capital lens, this article unpacks the access to the labour market and occupational positions of Swiss and Swedish migrant professionals in mainland China. Differentiated by how they can capitalize upon their educational, occupational, social and cultural resources in this specific context, the article distinguishes between three categories: corporarate expatriates, local hires and entrepreneurs and concludes with policy recommendations to stabilize their residence conditions."
European Union's construction of international identity via strategic partnerships: associating and social distancing.,"Song, Weiqing; Hall, Rodney Bruce",Contemporary Politics,Taylor & Francis Ltd,INTERNATIONAL relations; MILITARY strategy; NORMATIVITY (Ethics); CHINA; UNITED States; EUROPEAN Union,China; discursive construction; European Union; international identity; strategic partnership; the United States,"The European Union (EU) has developed a series of 'strategic partnerships' with a range of great power states. These partnerships reflect the emergence of an actor that seeks to establish foreign policy goals with an attendant institutional architecture and political commitment. This paper examines two of these partnerships with the United States and China to illustrate the manner in which the EU has constructed a collective identity for itself via discursive association with great power states, while claiming a normative character as an actor of a different kind, with the ability to act strategically with great power states via temporal and ethical forms of social distancing from these same actors. This paper consults recent survey research and policy developments to assess the success of these EU discursive strategies. It is concluded that these partnerships play a somewhat useful role in establishing the EU as an actor of global significance, whilst the EU is less successful in its inherent claims of normative superiority."

With Hong Kong being an international financial centre, Hong Kong's financial services remain one of the major economic pillars, accounting for 17.7% of the Hong Kong's GDP and employed 253,100 people in 2016 (HKTDC, 2018). On the other hand, the total net worth of the wealthiest 21 mega-tycoons in Hong Kong summed up to HK$1.83 trillion, which is equal to the Hong Kong government's fiscal reserves. While wealth gap has worsened, the government has accumulated a budget surplus of over HK$690 billion over the past ten years; the fiscal reserves have even surpassed the HK$1.1 trillion mark in 2018 (Legislative Council Secretariat, [18])."
Evasive balancing: India's unviable Indo-Pacific strategy.,"Rajagopalan, Rajesh",International Affairs,Oxford University Press / USA,GREAT powers (International relations); INTERNATIONAL relations; INDO-Pacific Region; INDIA -- Politics & government; INDIA -- Foreign relations -- 1984-; CHINA-United States relations,Asia; China; East Asia; India; International Relations theory; realism,"India has adopted the Indo-Pacific concept with uncharacteristic speed. This article examines India's Indo-Pacific strategy, which evolved out of its earlier 'Look East' and 'Act East' policies but is much more focused on strategic concerns than on trade or connectivity. As such, the strategy is subset of its China policy, and includes contradictory elements of balancing China by building partnerships with the United States as well as with regional powers, while simultaneously pursuing a reassurance strategy to convince Beijing that India is not really balancing China. The combination of these contradictory elements is characterized as evasive balancing, which is a more useful concept than either pure balancing or hedging for understanding the policies of India and of many other countries in the region that are trying to manage China's rise. However, reassurance strategies rarely work and the combination of balancing and reassurance is even less likely to be viable."
Evolution of North Korea's Peace Treaty Proposals and Sino-DPRK Relations Behind the Scenes.,Daekwon Son,Korea Observer,Institute of Korean Studies,"PEACE treaties; COLD War, 1945-1991; EVOLUTION (Biology); NORTH Korea",Inter-Korean peace treaty; peace regime; Sino-DPRK relations; U.S.-DPRK peace treaty,"This paper aims to explore the peace treaties that North Korea has sought with the United States and/or South Korea historically and how Sino-DPRK relations have influenced these treaty proposals. By exploring North Korea's various treaty proposals in chronological order and scrutinizing Sino-DPRK relations behind the proposals, this paper argues that North Korea's peace treaty proposals have been considerably opportunistic and situational, consistently changing to achieve strategic goals, and that Sino-DPRK relations invariably have been a significant factor behind the changes. Based on this observation, this paper concludes that North Korea's primary goal, after the end of the Cold War, fundamentally shifted from forceful reunification of the Korean peninsula to regime survival, and that China increasingly has been taking an active role in signing a peace treaty."

This paper showed a sharp, yet subtle departure of the Chinese government in its current manipulation of nationalism. Instead of the hardcore revolutionary rhetoric, the new phase of nationalist discourse incorporated many elements of Confucianism to better consolidate the communist regime. Using the 2015 military parade as an example, this paper analyzed how the Chinese central government evoked sentiments and consciousness of nationalism by utilizing and interweaving Confucianism elements of family value, benevolent (Ren), propriety (Li), equilibrium, and harmony into the party-state's official nationalist discourse. Significance of such organized endeavors in political discourse is discussed."

This gives Washington and Beijing potential leverage over small states to use within their competition with one another. This article explores the implications of this for New Zealand – a small South Pacific state that prides itself on maintaining an independent foreign policy. Situated within the small state literature, it utilises a material-based strategic triangle to illustrate the fundamental facets of New Zealand's position. Relatedly, the article examines how Wellington has managed its burgeoning relations with China and the US over the past decade and critically considers New Zealand's independent foreign policy. It finds that New Zealand has adopted a mixed set of strategies to manage its position between the US and China, closely aligning itself with Washington while remaining nonaligned on some key security issues in the Asia-Pacific region. New Zealand has certainly not opted for neutrality. The article concludes that New Zealand and other small states must remain vigilant, may want to consider alternative strategies of alignment, and outlines a number of areas where additional research could prove fruitful."

Though these institutions facilitated the process of solidifying one‐party rule in China and North Korea, the two countries' marketization has taken a different path. Unlike China, which had managed a gradual and stable marketization process, changes in North Korea's economic system have been driven by several unintended—but related—domestic factors such as a weakened central rationing system, the proliferation of black markets, and a weakened national pricing system. North Korea has attempted to absorb its informal markets into formal ones through some measures, but it has repeatedly returned to employing market control mechanisms. This article seeks to explain why the two socialist countries, China and North Korea, which were both receiving political and economic support from the Soviet Union when they established their respective institutions, pursue such different paths of institutional reform.

Explaining attractiveness: knowledge production and power projection in China's policy for Africa.,"Benabdallah, Lina",Journal of International Relations & Development,Palgrave Macmillan Ltd.,INTERNATIONAL relations; HUMAN capital; LEGAL documents; THEORY of knowledge; TRAINING,Africa; China; knowledge–power nexus; soft power,"How is Chinese foreign policy building a positive image of China in Africa? IR literature on soft power and attractiveness abounds. This study builds on the existing works, especially contributions by Janice Bially Mattern and Ty Solomon, to account for the role of expert knowledge production in attractiveness and image-building. While the existing literature focuses on China's media cooperation from the perspective of establishing Chinese media outlets in Africa, this article identifies an understudied aspect of China's strategy in Africa—that of investing in human resource development and professional training programmes for African journalists. The study constructs its analysis based on a series of in-depth interviews and official document analysis. The findings suggest that Chinese-sponsored professional development programmes for African journalists are an opportunity for African trainees to be socialised in Chinese values, norms, and expert knowledge. These trainings contribute to build a positive image of China in Africa and are far more successful than material approaches including establishing Chinese media outlets across Africa."

At Bretton Woods, delegates envisioned the World Bank as the focal organization mobilizing financial support for national development strategies. Today, this issue area is populated by no less than 27 multilateral development banks including the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and the New Development Bank created under Chinese leadership. This paper shows that, despite this institutional proliferation, the development finance regime remains largely coherent and core governance features designed at Bretton Woods continue to shape the emerging regime complex. We develop a historical institutionalist argument for why newly created institutions are likely to imitate extant institutions. We suggest that states add new institutions not only in response to deficiencies in extant institutions but also to increase their control and reputation. We analyze three causal pathways – path-dependence, orchestration, and independent learning – that contribute to a coherent regime complex. We show that focal international organizations can use their position to prevent incoherence."
Explaining heterogeneous afforestation outcomes: How community officials and households mediate tree cover change in China.,"Zinda, John Aloysius; Zhang, Zhiming",World Development,Elsevier B.V.,SUSTAINABLE development; LOCAL government; AFFORESTATION; FORESTS & forestry -- China; VEGETATION dynamics; CHINA,China; Community; Forest; Forest restoration; Governance; Livelihoods,"• We examine uneven vegetation change in China's Returning Farmland to Forest Program. • Analyses find no direct effect of RFFP on vegetation change across communities. • Self-serving, community-oriented, and perfunctory officials facilitated different pathways. • Effects of leadership on forest hinge on how it joins with livelihoods and ecology. Afforestation efforts are proliferating as states promote tree-planting to accomplish sustainable rural development and combat forest loss and climate change. China's Returning Farmland to Forest Program (RFFP), one of the world's most ambitious afforestation programs, has often been presented as a great success. However, research on the RFFP shows substantial unexplained heterogeneity. Case studies reveal divergent outcomes, but the processes behind local variation are poorly understood. This study examines mechanisms differentiating tree cover change across 12 communities. We join narrative histories with formal case comparison using fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA), which applies Boolean analysis to identify combinatorial patterns across cases, to explain variation in remotely sensed land cover change. These analyses identify distinct pathways to vegetation gain and loss linked to livelihood patterns and environmental conditions. The RFFP's contribution to forest gain depends on how local governance and environmental conditions enable different land use patterns. In particular, whether community officials act in responsive, self-serving, or perfunctory ways shapes options available to other households. Responsive governance does not have a consistent relationship with forest gain; outcomes depend on the particular activities officials enable. Impacts on land cover change of labor outmigration, livestock husbandry, and cash crop expansion are likewise contingent. To make afforestation interventions effective and sustainable, policymakers must be mindful of crosscutting factors that may impede or facilitate forest establishment."

Specifically, it examines the underlying reasons for which U.S. inhibition policy toward North Korea has failed, despite the numerous attempts by U.S. administrations (both Republicans and Democrats) to prevent North Korea's nuclear development. The central thesis of the article is that while there were multiple reasons for the American failure of North Korean proliferation, the most important ones were U.S. misperceptions about both North Korea's and China's intentions and U.S. distraction by the war on terror. These factors, along with Pyongyang's shrewd strategies to manipulate Washington, Seoul, and Beijing, played a key role in the emergence of a nuclear North Korea."

The field of historical studies on Chinese kinship is a highly contested domain, especially regarding the nature and role of lineages. Therefore, we designed our article as a ""conceptual case study"": we reflect upon the state of our knowledge about Chinese kinship in the traditional sense, develop a tentative conceptual framework, and apply this on our case. Central issues include the relationship between descent as constructed and performed via kinship rituals and patterns of cooperation among members of a lineage and the wider surname group."

Using data collected from two waves of large-scale telephone surveys in Guangzhou, China, we found that budget information was negatively associated with budget satisfaction, but positively related to perceived public service performance through increased citizen trust. These findings provide empirical evidence for understanding the complex relationship between budget information and citizens' perceptions of government performance, and suggest useful strategies for government to enhance citizens' trust and improve communications with citizens."

I make this argument by writing a boundary biography (Megoran, 2006, 2012) about a fence, bringing both history and ethnography to bear on border studies. Specifically, this biography analyzes the Nepal-China border at Mustang-Tibet in two distinct dimensions: 1) the physical (or external) location of the border as a marker of state territory between Nepal and China; and 2) the social and cultural (or internal) location of the border for borderland populations of Tibetan ethnicity. In correspondence to Salter's (2011) formal, practical, and popular registers of bordering, I use ethnography, readings of diplomatic history, and policy analysis to examine social-political transformations at the Nepal-China border through three specific changes over time. These key moments reflect important state interventions which together shape how the Mustang-Tibet border is experienced in Himalayan borderland lives today. In so doing, this biography shows how borders materialize, dematerialize, and rematerialize and how local populations' identities and geographic imaginaries are influenced and oriented by the border (Sahlins, 1989). By demonstrating how border lives are often shaped and maintained with and across the border rather than against the border itself, this study presents emerging research on Asian borderlands to rethink classic concepts on bordering developed in European and wider global contexts."
Factors Influencing Participation in Bilateral Interprovincial Agreements: Evidence from China's Pan Pearl River Delta.,"Chen, Bin; Ma, Jie; Feiock, Richard; Suo, Liming",Urban Affairs Review,Sage Publications Inc.,PROVINCIAL governments; BILATERAL treaties; SUBNATIONAL governments; LOCAL government; CHINESE provinces,dyadic network analysis; interprovincial agreements; regional network governance; urban governance,"China's provincial governments increasingly participate in interprovincial agreements (IPAs) to address regional policy problems. Nevertheless, limited research investigates the determinants of a province's propensity to engage in bilateral agreements with another province. This article uses network data and employs network regressions to investigate this question in the context of China's Pan Pearl River Delta (PPRD) regional network governance. We assess the factors that influence participation of bilateral IPAs among PPRD members. Our findings provide evidence that interprovincial participation in bilateral agreements spanning seven policy domains is driven by geographic proximity, economic and political statuses, institutional similarity, and cross-province leadership posting."
"Father Migration and Mother Migration: Different Implications for Social, School, and Psychological Adjustment of Left-Behind Children in Rural China.","Chen, Xinyin; Li, Dan; Liu, Junsheng; Fu, Rui; Liu, Shihong",Journal of Contemporary China,Taylor & Francis Ltd,EMIGRATION & immigration; FATHERS; MOTHERS; ADJUSTMENT (Psychology); SOCIAL skills in children; TEACHER evaluation,,"This study examined the relations between parental migration and the adjustment of left-behind children and the mediating role of parental support in rural China. Data were collected for 4,429 students (2,229 boys, M age = 12 years) in public schools from peer evaluations, teacher ratings, self-reports, and school records. The analyses revealed different patterns of relations of mother migration and father migration to children's adjustment. Whereas mother migration was negatively associated with children's social competence and academic achievement and positively associated with children's psychological problems, father migration was positively associated with children's positive adjustment, mainly through the mediation of maternal support. The results concerning the different implications of father migration and mother migration for children's adjustment and the critical role of maternal support represent a significant contribution to the understanding of human development in the contemporary rural Chinese context. The results are also useful for policy-makers and professionals to develop programs and strategies to help rural left-behind children in China."
Fields of Practice: Symbolic Binding and the Qing Defense of Sinocentric Diplomacy.,"Banks, David E",International Studies Quarterly,Oxford University Press / USA,"SYMBOLISM in politics; DIPLOMACY; LEGITIMATION (Sociology); FIELD theory (Social psychology); CHINA -- Foreign relations -- Great Britain; CHINA -- Foreign relations -- 1644-1912; QING dynasty, China, 1644-1912",,"The practice turn in IR offers new ways to understand how diplomats can creatively engage with their environment and one another. Yet, sometimes their diplomatic practices limit their ability to achieve agreements. This article focuses on how and why domestic practices conflict with international practices, and why states sometimes might feel constrained into engaging in practices that harm their international position. Drawing on field theory, I introduce a causal mechanism I call symbolic binding that explains why regimes may become so bound by their domestic practices of legitimation that they incur considerable international cost. Symbolic binding occurs when the symbolic practices needed to generate domestic legitimacy intersect and conflict with practices from the diplomatic field, when domestic audiences are observing the diplomatic interaction, and when regimes have limited access to alternative forms of political capital. I demonstrate the logic of this mechanism by analyzing the antagonistic diplomacy that occurred between Britain and China from the late eighteenth until the late nineteenth century. I show that the root of this diplomatic conflict can be linked to the incompatibility of both states' diplomatic practices and show how the Qing regime's need to maintain domestic legitimacy constrained it into steadfastly adhering to diplomatic practices that were incompatible with that of encroaching European powers."
Financial Reform with Chinese Characteristics.,"Dufour, Mathieu",Rethinking Marxism,Taylor & Francis Ltd,"CHINA; FINANCIAL institutions; NONFICTION; FINANCIAL Institutions & Development in China (Book); GABRIEL, Satyananda J.",China; Chinese Expansion; Economic Transition; Financial Reform; State Capitalism,"This essay reviews Financial Institutions and Development in China, by Satyananda J. Gabriel. In this book, the author studies the role played by the financial system in China's economic expansion and in the gradual transformation of that sector. The author's description of the financial sector is detailed and the information he provides is useful in picturing the various parts of the Chinese financial system. The author also raises important questions regarding financial reforms in China and how they have shaped capital accumulation. However, he falls short of his ambitious goal of elucidating the role of the financial sector in the Chinese expansion. There are important issues with the organization of the book, the analytical framework used, and the evidence or arguments brought forward to support many of the book's claims. As such, the reader is left without satisfactory answers to many of the intriguing questions raised in the book."
Financing China's unprecedented infrastructure boom: the evolution of capital structure from 1978 to 2015.,"Zhao, Jerry Zhirong; Su, Guocan; Li, Dan",Public Money & Management,Taylor & Francis Ltd,GOVERNMENT securities; CHINA; CAPITAL structure; INFRASTRUCTURE funds; FINANCE; DEBT,Capital structure; debt financing; infrastructure finance; public budgeting; public–private partnership (PPP),"The authors examine the sources of the funds that have financed China's infrastructure development since 1978. They define the five periods in which this development has taken place in terms of predominant financing: fiscal funds, build-operate-transfer (BOT), treasury bonds, the land financing, and local bonds. The system is characterized by a heavy reliance on debt financing and one-off revenues. These approaches have raised widespread concerns about fiscal sustainability in China. The authors explain why a shift towards the more conventional approach of fiscal funds is necessary. China's infrastructure development since 1978 has been characterized by a heavy reliance on debt financing and one-off revenues. The model raises the concern about the country's long-term fiscal sustainability. China should shift towards the more conventional approach of using fiscal funds to support infrastructure."

Fixing the emissions trading scheme: Carbon price stability in the EU and China.,"Boute, Anatole; Zhang, Hao",European Law Journal,Wiley-Blackwell,PRICE regulation; EMISSIONS trading; CHINA; EUROPEAN Union; GREEN marketing; CARBON & the environment,,"This paper critically questions the legal and economic foundation of price regulation in environmental markets, with a focus on the European Union (EU) and Chinese Emissions Trading Schemes (ETSs). In 2018, the EU adopted a structural reform of its own ETS with the objective of increasing and stabilising carbon prices. This reform raises fundamental questions concerning the free market nature of the ETS and its function as a driver of low‐carbon investments. On the one hand, regulatory adjustments are necessary to address the large surplus of allowances that can result from exogenous shocks (e.g. economic downturn). On the other hand, the risk of regulatory intervention in the market undermines investor certainty. In China, limited regulatory independence and more stringent government control over the market exacerbates the threat posed by price control measures to the integrity of China's ETS and its role as a driver of investments in environmental protection."
"Floating in Mud to Reach the Skies: Victor Sassoon and the Real Estate Boom in Shanghai, 1920s–1930s.","Chung, Stephanie Po-yin",International Journal of Asian Studies,Cambridge University Press,,architecture; finance; Shanghai; Victor Sassoon,"The historical waterfront of Shanghai known as the Bund, one of the most impressive architectural landscapes in Asia, was described in the 1930s in Fortune magazine as having ""the tallest buildings outside the American continent; the biggest hoard of silver in the world"" and being ""the cradle of new China"". 1 At a time when the US economy was in ruins and much of China was besieged by civil war, Shanghai's foreign concessions provided a safe haven for Chinese and foreign investors. With the influx of hot money, Shanghai experienced an unprecedented building boom. Notable among these real estate developers was Sir Ellice Victor Elias Sassoon (1881–1961, hereafter Victor Sassoon) who transferred much of his wealth from India to Shanghai and then transformed the Shanghai skyline. Inspired by American skyscrapers, Sassoon decided to build the first skyscraper in Shanghai, which would also be the first in the Eastern hemisphere, even though Shanghai's muddy ground had never supported a building of that height before. This article documents how the evolution of treaty port architecture in China owed much to Victor Sassoon. Its innovations – from the advent of skyscrapers, with their Art Deco style and mixed-use function, to the engineering methods and financial arrangements that built them – bore Sassoon's stamp. As will be seen, Sassoon's experiment paid off handsomely."

The core argument is that regimes can anticipate the events that create these focal points and engage in preemptive repression to survive their passing. This dynamic produces predictable, often cyclical patterns in repression. An analysis of dissident detentions in China from 1998 to 2014 shows that ""focal events"" alone appear to be responsible for more than 20 percent of dissident detentions over the analysis period. Such detentions tend to be shorter and rely less on formal criminal procedures, suggesting a ""catch-and-release"" dynamic. Additional analysis of detentions in Tibet shows how the calendar may vary by issue or group."

We argue that documenting aid-like activities in earlier historical periods helps shed new light on the systemic political dynamics of aid giving. We introduce a framework that links aid giving to the status quo in international politics and populate the framework with a diverse set of historical and contemporary cases, including Western and non-Western donors. Our analysis reveals striking similarities between the ways in which donor governments from diverse regions, historical periods, and international systems have utilised aid and other forms of concessional finance to pursue international political goals. Our findings suggest that by considering the pre-Marshall Plan roots of aid researchers can more effectively link foreign aid provision to rising power dynamics, international formal and informal hierarchies, and other research agendas in international relations. Our analysis also points to the need for greater attention to non-Western and pre-World War II evidence in understanding the link between aid and systems of international relations that have been less prevalent in the post-Marshall Plan era."
Foreign competition and quality sorting: Overlaps in US and Chinese exports.,"Mau, Karsten",World Economy,Wiley-Blackwell,INTERNATIONAL competition; EXPORTS; CHINA; MARKET exit; PLACE marketing; MARKET share,China; export competition; product heterogeneity; quality; United States,"The paper studies the performance of US exports conditional on presence and magnitude of Chinese exports in the same foreign markets. Outcomes within product—destination markets are analysed in a panel covering 4,219 products, 67 destinations and 11 years (1996–2006). Generally, an increasing exposure to Chinese export competition is related with lower US export revenues, quantity and market shares. Robustness checks support existence and direction of a causal relationship. Other outcomes, such as product switching, market exit and export unit value adjustments are less clear‐cut. Detailed analyses of responses in individual destinations and product categories suggest that this is, partly, because Chinese and US exports compete only in some markets. In product markets where lower US export quantity coincides with adjustments of export unit value, quality sorting appears to be prevalent. In some cases, however, lower export unit values appear to help export quantities remain unchanged. Overall, the average estimated displacement effects obtained from a pooled sample mask substantial panel‐unit heterogeneity."

Foreign Domestic Helpers Hiring and Women's Labor Supply in Hong Kong.,"He, Guangye; Wu, Xiaogang",Chinese Sociological Review,Taylor & Francis Ltd,LABOR supply; HOUSING subsidies; WORKING hours; HONG Kong (China); MARRIED people; MARRIED women; SOCIAL dynamics,,"Based on the data from Hong Kong Panel Study of Social Dynamics (HKPSSD), this article investigates the effect of hiring foreign domestic helpers (FDH) on married women's labor supply in Hong Kong. The results show, hiring FDHs promotes female's labor force participation in Hong Kong, increases the amount of time they spend on paid work, and reduces their share of housework. Further analysis suggests that the effects of hiring helpers vary substantially across different socioeconomic groups. The positive effect of hiring FDHs on work hours is the greatest among those who hold an upper-secondary education, live in subsidized housing, and are married to men who earn a relatively low income. These women work longer hours to meet their family's ends. For married women of higher socioeconomic status, the effect of FDHs hiring on work time is insignificant, suggesting that their relief from housework contributes not to their market work but rather to the support for a more leisurely lifestyle."
Foreign Policy Activities of China in the Middle East: Establishing Energy Security or Being a Responsible Emerging Power?,"Ponížilová, Martina",Journal of Balkan & Near Eastern Studies,Taylor & Francis Ltd,ENERGY security; CONFLICT management; MIDDLE East; MOTIVATION (Psychology); CHINA -- Foreign relations,,"The strategic map of the Middle East is slowly changing, with traditional powers retreating from the regional management and with the expanding power vacuum in the region. Lately, growing attention is focused on emerging powers such as China that have capabilities and potential to increase their engagement in regional politics and conflict management. However, the question is if China as the most powerful of contemporary emerging powers and an important trade and energy partner of Middle Eastern countries is willing and able to take on the role of an extra-regional leader that will stabilize the regional order. This article explains motivations behind Chinaʼs Mid-East policy and shows that although China is increasing its presence in the region, it is not yet ready to become a major force in shaping regional politics."
Forest Fire Susceptibility Modeling Using a Convolutional Neural Network for Yunnan Province of China.,"Zhang, Guoli; Wang, Ming; Liu, Kai",International Journal of Disaster Risk Science,Springer Nature,GEOGRAPHIC information systems; YUNNAN Sheng (China); CHINA; FOREST fires; WILDFIRES; FOREST fire prevention & control; FOREST fire management; MULTILAYER perceptrons; RECEIVER operating characteristic curves; WILCOXON signed-rank test,China; Convolutional neural network; Forest fire susceptibility; Geographic information system; Machine learning,"Forest fires have caused considerable losses to ecologies, societies, and economies worldwide. To minimize these losses and reduce forest fires, modeling and predicting the occurrence of forest fires are meaningful because they can support forest fire prevention and management. In recent years, the convolutional neural network (CNN) has become an important state-of-the-art deep learning algorithm, and its implementation has enriched many fields. Therefore, we proposed a spatial prediction model for forest fire susceptibility using a CNN. Past forest fire locations in Yunnan Province, China, from 2002 to 2010, and a set of 14 forest fire influencing factors were mapped using a geographic information system. Oversampling was applied to eliminate the class imbalance, and proportional stratified sampling was used to construct the training/validation sample libraries. A CNN architecture that is suitable for the prediction of forest fire susceptibility was designed and hyperparameters were optimized to improve the prediction accuracy. Then, the test dataset was fed into the trained model to construct the spatial prediction map of forest fire susceptibility in Yunnan Province. Finally, the prediction performance of the proposed model was assessed using several statistical measures—Wilcoxon signed-rank test, receiver operating characteristic curve, and area under the curve (AUC). The results confirmed the higher accuracy of the proposed CNN model (AUC 0.86) than those of the random forests, support vector machine, multilayer perceptron neural network, and kernel logistic regression benchmark classifiers. The CNN has stronger fitting and classification abilities and can make full use of neighborhood information, which is a promising alternative for the spatial prediction of forest fire susceptibility. This research extends the application of CNN to the prediction of forest fire susceptibility."
"Forging a Women's United Front: Chinese elite women's networks for national salvation and resistance, 1932–1938.","GUO, VIVIENNE XIANGWEI",Modern Asian Studies,Cambridge University Press,"ELITE (Social sciences); WOMEN in politics; ZHONGGUO guo min dang (Political party); WOMEN -- China; SINO-Japanese War, 1937-1945",,"Focusing on Chinese elite women who gravitated towards national affairs in the pre-war urban sites of eastern China and who migrated to Wuhan after the outbreak of the War of Resistance (1937–1945), this article analyses the emergence, development, and integration of their sociopolitical networks for the purpose of promoting women's participation in national salvation, against a backdrop of the deepening national crisis in the 1930s. I argue that two years before the Second Kuomintang-Chinese Communist Party (KMT-CCP) United Front was officially formed, these elite women, hailing from diverse social and political backgrounds and different professions, had already established their own leadership during the national salvation movement and called for a women's united front. Therefore, rather than being simply political rhetoric enhanced under the auspices of the KMT-CCP alliance, the women's united front served as an important institution with which Chinese elite women identified and through which they empowered themselves at a local and then national level, across and beyond geopolitical boundaries. I conclude that the birth and evolution of this women's united front, which have been neglected in the historiography of China's War of Resistance, are crucial to an understanding of unsettling negotiations, communication, and cooperation between the various forces signed up to the cause of national salvation in the 1930s, and to the interpretation of popular resistance before the war."

It is by far the most watched foreign policy initiative that the PRC has projected on the world stage. Departing from the standard focus on BRI's external ambition, this article investigates the political dynamics inside the Chinese state, which has driven and will continue to shape the contour and magnitude of the BRI in the future. The article builds a theory of state fragmentation and argues that the Belt and Road is a mobilization campaign by the Communist leadership in order to deal with domestic and diplomatic challenges. Mobilization, however, intensifies fragmentation and results in the decentralized implementation of the BRI that diverges from the rhetoric of the strategy. Lower-level governments and major business groups leverage on the BRI and devise projects and programs that serve their economic interests. On the one hand, economic growth is being revived in the localities; on the other, restructuring and rebalancing of the Chinese economy are delayed."

Environmental nongovernment organizations' (ENGOs) issue interpretation and presentation affect environmental policy changes. The notion of 'frame alignment' is introduced, and it is argued that it can serve to link ENGOs' advocacy needs and frame resonance among different stakeholders, thus successfully promoting advocacy. Based on in-depth interviews and analysis of news reports over a span of 10 years, it is found that where ENGOs are able to align their issue frames with those of the central state and media, the resulting frame resonance smooths policy change. In contrast, where ENGOs adopt conflict frames critical of state authorities, the absence of alignment leads to a slim chance of policy change. The findings shed light on why some ENGOs successfully create linkage and achieve their desired outcomes while others fail to do so."

To that end, it drew insights from framing theory and conducted an in-depth inductive frame analysis based on a representative sample of official documents and news articles. 14 frames (7 frames and 7 counterframes) emerged therefrom. They represent the AIIB debate along six dimensions: China vis-à-vis AIIB (Tool, We're all equal), AIIB for members (Boon, Bane), AIIB versus status quo (Rival, Complement, Winds of change), standards (Made in China, Qualified yes, Up to par), prospects (Off to a good start, Not all roses), and external reactions (Game, Much ado about nothing). Building on the frames identified, the study went further to show how political actors applied frames in their (self-)justificatory discourse, and how media enriched the debate by bringing in frames absent from the official discussions in the political circle. The findings herein not only attest to the contested nature of the AIIB and the diverging framing by different actors, but shed some light on the wider discussions on China's evolving relations with the incumbent global system and established powers."

From centralisation to fragmentation and back again: the role of non-state actors in Brazil's transformed foreign policy.,"Cardoso, Daniel",Third World Quarterly,Taylor & Francis Ltd,POLICY sciences; DECENTRALIZATION in government; HIERARCHIES; ORGANIZATIONAL structure; GOVERNMENT policy; BRICS countries; BRAZIL -- Foreign relations; BRAZIL -- Politics & government -- 1889-,Brazil; BRICS and rising powers; China; foreign policy; participation and power,"Since the 1990s, Brazil's foreign policy-making, traditionally a highly centralised and hierarchical process, has become more fragmented, plural and horizontal. In this context, the role of non-state actors has been increasingly relevant. The impact and significance of these actors have been however a matter of debate. While there are authors that consider that non-state actors play only a secondary role in the policy-making process, there are others that assert that these actors work alongside governmental actors and directly influence policy choices. Drawing on the concept of network governance, the paper proposes a different view from the two recurrent approaches in the literature mentioned above. It argues that the recent steps to transform Brazil's state governance from hierarchy to horizontal networks have indeed expanded the room for the direct participation of non-state actors in the policy process. However, state authorities fought to adjust this tendency, in order to retain control over the decision-making process, by putting in place formal and informal coordinating mechanisms led by the Ministry of Foreign Relations and the Presidency. This suggests Brazil's foreign policy was made in the shadow of hierarchy. The paper demonstrates the argument using the case of Brazil's foreign policy towards China."

It applies the terms of 'decentralized cooperation' and 'twinning' into the analysis of China's aid architecture, drawing a connection between aid and domestic politics. With evidence from East Africa, it argues that it is the endogenous twinning mechanism and the deep involvement of subnational actors that make Chinese aid structurally distinct from those of other donors, particularly in the area of health, agriculture and education. It finds that the involvement of subnational actors brings in more resources for the sustainability of China's aid programs, while the multiple faces and institutional capacity of subnational Chinese actors giving aid may require further examination."

From Denial to Punishment: The Security Dilemma and Changes in India's Military Strategy towards China.,"Joshi, Yogesh; Mukherjee, Anit",Asian Security,Taylor & Francis Ltd,MILITARY strategy; CHINA; NAUTICAL training schools,,"This article argues that China's rise and its growing military power have intensified the Sino-Indian security dilemma. For a long time after the 1962 war, India's military posture along the India-China border was mostly defensive in nature and could be characterized as imposing ""deterrence by denial."" However, over the last decade, China's growth trajectory coupled with rapid modernization of its military called into question the efficacy of this approach. India now feels much more vulnerable to China's increasing military power both on the land frontier as well as in the maritime domain. The increasing intensity of this security dilemma has informed a consequent shift in India's military strategy vis-à-vis China to one of ""deterrence by punishment."" Theoretically, this article examines how changes in the severity of a security dilemma can lead to changes in military strategy. While doing so it explains India's current military strategy to deal with the challenge posed by China."
From Engagement to Competition? The Logic of the US China Policy Debate.,"Chang‐Liao, Nien‐chung",Global Policy,Wiley-Blackwell,"CONSENSUS (Social sciences); NATIONAL security; CHINA-United States relations; UNITED States; CONJOINT analysis; TRUMP, Donald, 1946-",,"This article explores the logic of the ongoing debate in the United States over its China policy. Scholarly assessments of China's power and intentions are more diverse than ever before, so it is no wonder that the United States is faced with an array of policy options, including continuing engagement, accommodation, competition and containment. This makes it more difficult for US policy makers to forge a consensus regarding the course of engagement with China. This paper provides an analytic framework for explaining the logic of US policy choices within the debate and examines the implications for the Trump administration. It is hoped that it can help US policy makers interpret China's rise, and act as a baseline from which they can formulate an optimal approach towards dealing with the PRC. With the debate over the United States' China policy yet to be settled, the future of US–China relations, as well as the wellbeing of the entire Asia‐Pacific region, remains uncertain. In particular, President Trump's erratic attitude toward Beijing is puzzling to outside observers and is undermining US credibility. It is creating instability in the Asia Pacific where Washington had previously been a stabilizing force."
From factions to fractions: India's foreign policy roles across different party systems.,"Friedrichs, Gordon",India Review,Taylor & Francis Ltd,COALITION governments; PARTISANSHIP; ELECTIONS; BHARATIYA Janata Party; CHINA-India relations; INDIA,,"India's government under Narendra Modi represents a return to single party rule. This paper investigates whether and why single party governments in India differ in their extremity of foreign policies from coalition governments. It particularly focuses on how different forms of government influence the saliency, contestation, and enactment of national conceptions about India's global role. First, I situate India within the academic debate regarding coalitional governments and foreign policy. I suggest that one reason why India challenges scholars' assumption is the missing link between partisan conceptions of India's global role and their institutional representation. Second, I propose a role theoretical approach and argue that the process of self-identification, consisting of ego and anticipated alter expectations, conditions a state's role set and extreme foreign policy. It is hypothesized that the nature of contestation of national role conceptions varies between factions and fractions because of the nature of India's party system, as well as the relative significance of external others for India's identity. Third, I examine instances of role-taking in the field of nuclearization and Sino-Indian relations. Findings suggest that contested role conceptions during single-party rule caused more extreme variances in international role-taking, while coalition governments proved to induce more complementary role-taking processes."

The A-, E-, and M-motives are considered as social motives related to three social spheres: governance, economy, and culture respectively. An individual or instinctual (I) motive is introduced as an additional motive that should be considered by political economists to help understand the distinction between foraging and productive behavior. Anderson then provides a brief interpretation of economic development in the Soviet Union, China, oil-rich countries, and the West to show the value of Gaforov's approach to political economy."

Using his previously developed paradigm of administrative (A), economic (E), and moral (M) motives for production, Gafurov explains differences between state-run and private industries, and the nostalgia arising for Soviet production under Stalin in the former USSR. He then explains the fundamental difference was the Chinese Communist Party's ability to introduce capitalism without losing control of the system, while Russia only reluctantly allowed private enterprise after the system collapsed."
From Heaven to Earth: 'Cultural Idealism' and 'Moral Realism' as Chinese Contributions to Global International Relations.,"Acharya, Amitav",Chinese Journal of International Politics,Oxford University Press / USA,"MORAL realism; INTERNATIONAL relations theory; INTERNATIONAL relations; IDEALISM; CHINA; QING hua da xue (Beijing, China); CHINESE; HEAVEN",,"The discipline of International Relations (IR) is increasingly being criticized for ignoring and marginalizing states and societies outside of the core countries of the West. The idea of a 'Global IR' has been proposed since 2014 a pathway toward a bridging the 'West and the Rest' divide and thus develop a more inclusive discipline, recognizing its multiple and diverse foundations. At the same time, there is a trend toward developing theories, or 'schools', on a national or regional basis, the leading examples of which come from China. This article examines some theoretical constructs emerging in China, such as the 'Relational Theory' of Qin Yaqing, who is the foundational scholar in the 'Chinese School of IR', the Tianxia ('all under Heaven') concept as applied to IR and world order by Zhao Tingyang, and 'Moral Realism' of Yan Xuetong, who is the leading figure of the 'Tsinghua School'. To many scholars, both inside and outside China, the relationship among the various Chinese approaches and their overall contribution to the IR field remain unclear. Without claiming to capture all their nuances and complexity, this article hopes to stimulate a conversation among scholars, Chinese and foreign, with a view to generate greater clarity and highlight their importance to the study of IR. I argue that while making important contributions, the Chinese approaches to International Relations Theory (IRT) also face a number of challenges. This includes the need for them to offer more convincing proof that the concepts and explanations they propose can apply to other societies and to IR more generally. Moreover, there is the need for these approaches to attract a critical mass of followers worldwide, stimulate a research agenda for other, especially younger scholars, and distance themselves from the official Chinese policy framings. The Global IR approach offers a helpful framework for highlighting and perhaps addressing these challenges, especially in avoiding cultural exceptionalism and ensuring their wider relevance beyond China."
From Internet to social safety net: The policy consequences of online participation in China.,"Jiang, Junyan; Meng, Tianguang; Zhang, Qing",Governance,Wiley-Blackwell,INTERNET & politics; PUBLIC welfare policy; POLITICAL participation; INTERNET users; DIGITAL technology; SOCIAL participation,,"Internet‐based platforms are increasingly being used by governments around the world to facilitate public engagement with citizens. However, it remains an open question whether participation through these platforms can actually enable citizens to influence policies. We address this question by studying the patterns and consequences of online participation at a major electronic petition platform in China, a country with the world's largest Internet‐using population. Content analysis of over 900,000 petitions reveals that a substantial share of them concern lower‐class issues and are originated from less developed rural and suburban areas. Linking variations in petition volumes to an original data set of government policy priorities, we further show that online participation led governments to place greater emphasis on social welfare policies and to increase the coverage of a key low‐income assistance program. These results underscore the potential of online participation as an important mechanism to improve the quality of governance."

The Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China represent twin communist party-ruled states. One collapsed while the other advances into an economic superpower. China stands as a ""black swan"" challenge to Western political science and political economy. Using Akmal Gafurov's innovative A-E-M paradigm on socio-behavioral incentives and Gordon Anderson's additional I-motive, this paper seeks to explain how incentives worked for the PRC in the last seven decades. It traces the evolution of China's Government Productive Economic Structure and examines the interactions of the four motives--administrative, economic, moral, and survival--during the Mao Zedong, Deng Xiaoping and Xi Jinping eras. China's successful reform has produced a system that is neither Soviet, nor Anglo-American, nor East Asian-developmental state. It has elements of all three."

There is a clear need for in-depth analysis of the extent to which the CCP has departed from the philosophical foundation of Marxism and Maoism, abandoned socialism and communism, inverted its long tradition of iconoclasm, transformed its own identity and altered its subject position. Part of the CCP's philosophical departure from Marxism and Maoism is its increasing conversion to nationalism. The new nationalism underpinning the Chinese Dream, in particular, operates against the grain of Marxism and Maoism, and vice versa, and is logically irreconcilable with the latter – so much so that the CCP cannot be nationalists and Marxists, Maoists or communists at the same time. The contradictory logics between nationalism and Marxism can be best seen from their respective conceptions of permanence and change, the unity and conflict of opposites, and conceptions of, and approaches to, tradition and the past, which have had major ramifications in political-cultural change in post-Mao China, especially in Xi's New Era."

Whereas law-making in China has often been described as a search for compromise, this case-study rather highlights the link between the entry of new actors into the legislative process and their role in rebalancing power relations among administrative agencies with conflicting views and interests, thereby directly impacting the reframing of the law. This case-study thus highlights consultative authoritarianism's permeability with power politics and social mobilization. Differentiating the 'entry moment' from the process whereby ENGOs durably become insiders, this article also investigates the conditions for sustainable inclusion and the way the inclusion process broadens. Pointing out that authoritarian participation differentiates from democratic participation because ENGOs are primarily included as experts, this article complements the consultative authoritarianism framework by arguing that expertise allows for a technocratic form of representation of the broader public deprived of the right to political participation, hence enabling the law to better reflect the general interest."

From there, he concluded that Africa, Latin America, and Asia, except for Japan, would compose the revolutionary forces capable of defeating imperialism, colonialism, and hegemonism. The start of international aid from the People's Republic of China to developing countries dates back to the period immediately after the Bandung Conference of 1955, extending to the present. Through a bibliographical and documentary analysis, the article starts with the following research question: What role did domestic and international factors play in China's foreign aid drivers over the years? To answer the question, the evolution of Chinese international assistance was studied from Mao to the Belt and Road Initiative, which is the complete expression of the country's 'quaternity' model of co-operation, combining aid, trade, investment, and technical assistance."

The possibility of a Sino-U.S. economic ""war,"" or the so-called ""new Cold War,"" not only indicates the escalation of this confrontation but also symptomizes the international order's transformation as a result of the change in power balance and rise of a challenger against the existing United States–led international liberal order. Most IR specialists focus on the prospects of this confrontation and its uncertain worldwide circumstances and are concerned about its impact on East Asian/Asia Pacific regional circumstances. Among them, prospects regarding regionalism and regional institutions in Asia seem pessimistic. However, Asian regionalism was activated following the decline in United States' power and rise of China as a global power, and the international liberal order's retreat became visible toward the end of the 2000s. Furthermore, even under the uncertain situations created by the Sino-U.S. confrontation, regional powers, including China, Japan, and the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN), are promoting their multilateral approach by proposing and advancing various regional frameworks. This indicates that each regional power is adopting the ""institutional hedging"" strategy to ensure that their individual interests are satisfied and the regional order is comfortable for themselves. This paper verifies that regionalism and regional institutions have become important as measures of regional power for countries' institutional hedging strategies to overcome the challenges posed by the beginning of regional uncertainties and that Asian regionalism is more active today than ever before."

For this purpose, it will first explain why status matters for rising powers. Second, it will present the linkage between status-seeking policies of states and state identity. Third, it exposes social creativity as a driver of state behaviour. And fourth, it focuses on G20 rising powers' quest for status through social creativity with a particular focus on South-South development cooperation."
Gauging Chinese Public Support for China's Role in Peacekeeping.,"Professor, Songying Fang Associate; Professor, Fanglu Sun Associate",Chinese Journal of International Politics,Oxford University Press / USA,PUBLIC support; PEACEKEEPING forces; UNITED Nations; GAGING; CHINA -- Politics & government -- 2002-,,"In recent years, Beijing has significantly increased its support for UN peacekeeping operations (UNPKOs). Of the five permanent members of the Security Council, China is currently the largest troop-contributing country and the second-largest financial contributor to the UN peacekeeping budget. What is the view of the Chinese public on its country's involvement in peacekeeping operations? We investigate the question using a public opinion survey experiment conducted in China. Our main findings are, first, that respondents showed a high level of support generally for China's participation in peacekeeping operations but highest of all when China performed a leadership role. Secondly, China's particular interest in a host country did not affect the degree of public support for China's involvement; however, respondents did perceive broad benefits to China's international reputation from such activities. Thirdly, although there was a similar level of support for China's participation in peacekeeping whether the mission was authorised by the United Nations or by the African Union, neither was seen as a substitute for host state consent. Finally, respondents generally preferred China to make personnel (military and police) contributions in addition to financial contributions. These findings provide important insights into the domestic motivations for Beijing's future peacekeeping policy and attendant constraints in this regard."

There, to cope with economic discrimination, by exploiting the social network WeChat, Chinese women produce physical and virtual transnational multipolar economies, connecting the society of departure, China, and of settlement, Taiwan. Engaging with the contemporary debate about migrants' translocal practices and economic transnationalism, this research article aims at elucidating the link between migration and entrepreneurship, through the case of Chinese migrant women's physical and virtual entrepreneurial activities across the Taiwan Strait. It explores the development of a specific culture of migration and of affections during the two mobility experiences, and the creation of gendered transnational networks across the borders. Thus, it provides empirical data for an understanding of Chinese women's cross‐strait migration in terms of interconnection, circulation and simultaneity."

The paper explores how Zuo created a coherent and flexible counter-insurgency doctrine that underpinned his suppression of the Taipings, the Nian, Muslim rebels of the northwest and the defeat of a massive Sufi revolt in Central Asia. The paper also shows how Zuo helped convince the Russians to return territory they occupied in Central Asia, thereby preserving the territorial integrity of the Qing Empire in the region."

Different generations have distinct historical experiences, which may shape their political stance across a spectrum of attitudes and behaviors. This symposium includes four articles analyzing generational politics in Taiwan and Hong Kong. The studies show that there are behavioral and attitudinal differences between the young and the old in both places. As overall voter turnout has declined in Taiwan, youth turnout has declined even more. In particular, the ""China factor"" is the main driving force to the younger generations' political activism. Youths in both Taiwan and Hong Kong exhibit a strong local identity that differentiates them from the Chinese. The stronger the identity is, the more politically active they are."

However, relatively little attention has been paid to how concerns over the rise of China may shape public attitudes towards such investment. This article tests the link between threat perception and preferences for FDI in the United States. We argue that, due to heightened geopolitical concerns and nationalism, perceptions of the China threat negatively affect how the American public views the impact of incoming Chinese FDI. Using a survey experiment, we show that respondents are indeed less likely to support Chinese FDI when primed with information that highlights the security and economic threats posed by China than when they receive no such priming. Furthermore, causal mediation analyses reveal that the treatment effects of security and economic threats are mediated by respondents' concerns about the challenges that Chinese FDI poses to national security as well as to American economy."
Getting out of Hand?

This so-called 'character amnesia' has provoked a heated debate, leading some to argue that Chinese characters—and even the Chinese and Japanese languages and cultures themselves—are facing a serious crisis. This article aims to examine the scope of this (predominantly alarmist) discourse and assess the coherence and validity of its arguments. In addition, it seeks to make sense of the possible forces and motives behind this upsurge in 'verbal hygiene' by answering such questions as: what led to the formation of such a discourse in the first place? What social functions might it serve, and what kinds of deep-rooted beliefs and anxieties does such a discourse reveal?"

Deputies mainly use two types of strategies: improving the persuasiveness of policy suggestions, which includes gathering information and providing specific and feasible solutions, and strengthening interactions with other political actors, through face-to-face persuasion, pressuring relevant departments, gaining support from congress leaders, and seeking support from public opinion. The article demonstrates how such strategies help some of the deputies make a difference in China's policy-making process."

By early 1945, Chinese from across the social spectrum resented the US military presence, but just one issue sparked a violent backlash: sexual relations between American soldiers (GIs) and Chinese women. Two interrelated, patriarchal narratives about sex emerged that spring. Starting in March, government-backed newspapers began criticizing ""Jeep girls,"" an epithet coined to describe the Chinese women who consorted with American servicemen. Rumors also circulated that GIs were using Jeeps to kidnap ""respectable"" women and rape them. Each narrative portrayed women's bodies as territory to be recovered and inextricable from national sovereignty. These narratives resonated widely, turning Jeep girls into the catalyst through which all variables causing resentment against the US military presence intersected and converged. With Japan on the ropes, China's allied friends now stood in the way of irreversibly consigning foreign imperialism to the past. Sexual relations were not the Sino–US alliance's seedy underside, but the core site of its tensions."

How can government mechanisms at the national, regional, and global levels promote transformational approaches designed to achieve economic, social, and environmental sustainability? China's rapid growth in the international arena and its increasing influence are unprecedented. The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), launched by Chinese President Xi Jinping during his visits to Central and Southeast Asia, has proposed a new strategic vision for trade and investment flows based on a concept of communications embodied in the ancient Silk Road. The BRI has become a powerful platform for economic growth and regional cooperation. Meanwhile, the range of financial instruments available to developing countries has been expanding with the establishment of new intergovernmental institutions such as the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB). This new international financial institution reflects a key change in the architecture of global governance. An analysis of China's contribution to the multilateral system shows its unprecedented growth and commitment to global governance, as written into the country's 13th Five-Year Plan. The principles of the United Nations 2030 Agenda, in turn, provide an agreed and inclusive basis for working out an international political approach to sustainable development with a focus on development cooperation. Global governance offers opportunities for further implementation of the U.N. Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In this context, the BRI reflects China's global role as a bridge builder. The BRI can make a contribution to global governance by suggesting an effective implementation mechanism so as to move towards a more balanced, multipolar, and multilateral international architecture. The BRI's gradual multilateralism will enhance China's legitimacy and prestige. If the BRI builds on the Sustainable Development Goals, this will enhance China's impact and give it additional advantages. Success will depend on concrete actions at the global, regional, national, and subnational levels. In addition, the BRI could be a driver of sustainable development, an effective tool for achieving the SDGs. Acting in harmony with the SDGs, the BRI will be able to promote the common good of participating countries in all areas of development. In this endeavor, regional and multilateral political frameworks are an important step in providing real win-win opportunities."
Global interpersonal income inequality decline: The role of China and India.,"Darvas, Zsolt",World Development,Elsevier B.V.,INCOME distribution; SIMULATION methods & models; CHINA; INDIA; PER capita; LORENZ curve; KERNEL functions,Development; Gini coefficient; Global and regional distribution of income; Income inequality; Simulation modelling,"• The accuracy of methods to calculate the global distribution of income has not yet been tested. • Among four methods, the Lorenz-curve regression method is the most accurate. The two-parameter distribution method is also very precise. • On the basis of our new dataset, we find that income inequality among the citizens of 145 countries declined significantly between 1988 and 2015. • Our new method to deconstruct the change in the global Gini coefficient of income inequality reveals that income convergence was the main driver. • Without China and India, global interpersonal income inequality in 143 countries was higher in 2015 than in 1988. While various methodologies have been used in the literature to estimate global interpersonal income inequality, the accuracy of these methods has not so far been tested. We compare the accuracy of four methods and find that the Lorenz curve regression method is the most accurate and robust, while the accuracy of the identical quantile income and the Kernel density methods depends on the level of detail about income shares. The simple two-parameter distribution method is also very accurate when either the Log-normal or the Weibull distribution is used. Using the two-parameter distribution method, we show that global income inequality among the citizens of 145 countries declined significantly between 1988 and 2015, largely because of the convergence of income per capita, which was offset to a small degree by the increase in within-country inequalities and the increased population share of poorer and more unequal countries. Regional income inequality declined in most parts of the world, with the notable exception of developing Asia where it has increased. Despite the large increases in within-China and within-India inequality, income convergence of the two countries drove down global income inequality. Without China and India, global interpersonal income inequality in 143 countries was higher in 2015 than in 1988, indicating that more than half of the world has not really become more equal."

These shifts are compelling Canada to reframe its relations with China. First, at the global level, the changing balance of power is leading us toward an era of polycentric global governance. Second, there is deepening antagonism in US–China relations. Third, China's international posture has become more assertive. Canada has yet to adjust, but it is well placed to develop a global worldview in sync with twenty-first century realities. The Canada–China relationship needs to be transformed into an adaptive, modular, and strategic relationship, in our dealings with China at the global level, in triangulating our relationships with the US and China, and within the confines of our bilateral relationship.

The article argues that falling global inequality is primarily due to China's development and that national inequality has risen in some developing countries and fallen in others. In light of the dominance of China's development in the global picture, questions arise as to what has changed and what has not changed outside of China. A set of changes and continuities is presented. It is then argued that these changes and continuities provide for the contemporary relevance an older conceptual lens — that of 'late development'."

Built on an inclusive foundation of peaceful co-existence, the AAJA contributed to the development of expansive global information networks, lively intellectual traffic, and rich visual arts among Afro-Asian nations. However, the cosmopolitanism of its early years was later undermined by the decline of constitutional democracy in Indonesia and a lack of cohesion among Afro-Asian nations. After the September Thirtieth Movement in Indonesia in 1965, the AAJA relocated to Beijing and was mobilized by the Chinese state to promote the P.R.C. as the leader of an embittered Third World's battle against American imperialism and Soviet revisionism. In the early 1970s, ideological fervor began abating in China. During this time, Mao's reframing of the three worlds, which was based on developmental measurements, redirected the AAJA's Third World discourse to issues of modernization until its quiet dissolution in 1974. The history of the AAJA demonstrates the complex and often conflicted ways in which two important post-colonial states - Indonesia and China - conceptualized ""the Third World"" and formulated media representations during the Cold War."
Globalisation and the Recent Trade Wars: Linkages and Lessons.,"Oramah, Benedict; Dzene, Richman",Global Policy,Wiley-Blackwell,"GLOBALIZATION; INTERNATIONAL trade disputes; ELECTIONS; BREXIT Referendum, 2016; UNITED States; CHINA-United States relations; DEVELOPING countries",,"Anti‐globalization sentiments have risen significantly in developed economies, impacting the outcome of national elections in the US and the BREXIT referendum in the United Kingdom. It has also led to tariff escalations and trade wars, especially between the US and China. These developments run contrary to the conventional wisdom that globalization has positively Impacted the global economy and that the distribution of gains has been in favor of developed economies. This paper argues that it is the incomplete implementation of the main pillars of globalization that has created rising discontent in developed countries. Conceived as the process of integration of goods, capital, technology and labor, globalization was premised on free movement of goods and factors of production within and across countries as well on the assumption that factors of production would be perfect substitutes everywhere. The paper posits that it is the immobility of labor across and within countries that has led to the globalization‐induced dislocations in some developed economies. Across countries, artificial immigration barriers restrict labor movement while within countries, labor market rigidities and absence of perfect substitution in the labor market constrain the migration of labor from the declining to the booming sectors of the economy creating large income inequalities. Implications of the foregoing for the future of globalization and Africa's export‐led industrialization are presented. No country can survive in isolation, but the full benefits of globalisation would be realised if all factors of production were allowed to move freely without restrictions."
Globalization and software piracy within and across 103 countries.,"Schmuhl, Margaret A.; Na, Chongmin","Crime, Law & Social Change",Springer Nature,GLOBALIZATION; LEGISLATIVE reform; DEVELOPING countries; PIRACY (Copyright); RANDOM effects model; ASIANS; DEVELOPED countries; COMPUTER software,Cross-national; Globalization; Intellectual property; Software piracy,"Globalization has been linked with many social problems, though little research has examined its relationship with software piracy. The ramifications of software piracy may vary across countries leading to varied criminal justice responses. More developed countries, which produce the most software and stand to gain the most from its protection, use diplomatic leverage to strengthen piracy laws in less developed countries. Consequently, lesser-developed countries are forced to adopt rigorous policies for IP protection. As such, we hypothesize that globalization will decrease software piracy rates over time. Using a modified random effect model, the current study examines the within and between countries effects of globalization on software piracy rates over time in 103 countries across a period of 14 years. Results indicate that globalization is significantly associated with a decrease in software piracy within and between countries over time while controlling for important time-varying and time invariant predictors. Interaction effects suggest that the relationship between globalization and software piracy is less pronounced in Asian countries and more pronounced in Latin American countries. In sum, some crimes, like software piracy, may be deterred if there are strong enough incentives and international pressures to regulate such crime through legislative and policy reforms."

Likewise, the analytical association between polarization and the party system in electoral democracies has focused, in most of the existing literature, on political polarization, leaving aside authoritarian or semi-authoritarian contexts where a fair multi-party election is absent or dysfunctional. By collecting and analyzing online posts about international terrorism from Sina Weibo in China, between January 2011 and December 2016, this study proves the existence of opinion polarization on terrorism in China's digital media sphere. By categorizing the findings into two camps, 'global war on terror discourse' and 'anti-imperialist narrative', the study elucidates these polarized attitudes in terms of their acceptance, denial and decomposition of the global discourse of fears about terrorism. Drawing on our case study, the study then proposes an alternative explanation for the motivation/driver of mass polarization in digitally networked communication in China, identified as the effect of globalization and localization."

Based on provincial panel data for the years 2003–15, the empirical study is conducted with difference‐in‐differences design. The first difference is whether a province is an OBOR province, and the second is whether ""One Belt & One Road"" initiative has been proposed. The empirical results suggest the utilisation of foreign capital in OBOR provinces has decreased significantly compared to non‐OBOR provinces after the initiative has been proposed. The study has further shown that the OBOR construction not only means factor movements and projects but also stands for policy shock. Its impact on utilisation of foreign capital cannot be simply captured by the commonly quantifiable ""going global"" indicators, namely outward direct investment, overseas contracted projects or overseas labour services. The negative impact of the initiative on foreign capital utilisation is strongly reflected in the OBOR provinces with low levels of economic development, heavy fiscal burdens and high proportions of state‐owned economy. In the short term, the negative impact of the initiative on foreign capital utilisation may be due to its role in resource competition and signal delivering. The former means that the OBOR initiative may induce resource competition between ""going global"" and ""bringing in,"" and the latter suggests that this initiative is likely to be regarded as a ""signal"" by foreign investors that ""going global,"" not ""bringing in,"" has become the priority of the government."

This is accomplished via mixed qualitative techniques involving interviews with illegal small‐scale Chinese and Ghanaian miners, and relevant Ghanaian stakeholders. Although the majority of Chinese interests in African mining is state sponsored, the Ghana case demonstrates private Chinese agency that is mostly attracted to illegal small‐scale mining in Ghana due to push factors in the homeland and pull factors associated with Ghanaian state weakness. The Chinese dominate the supply chain of illegal small‐scale mining with their financial, technical, managerial acumen, the sale and transfer of gold proceeds, and political patronage. This dominance accounts for the massive negative social, economic, environmental, and political impact of illegal small‐scale mining in the country. Amid state weakness, Ghanaian civil society, exercising agency, remains a potent force against the phenomenon.

Governing the poor in Guangzhou: Marginalization and the neo-liberal paternalist construction of deservedness.,Wen Zhuoyi; Ngok Kinglun,China Information,"Sage Publications, Ltd.",SOCIAL marginality; NEOLIBERALISM; GUANGZHOU (China),minimum living standard scheme; neo-liberal paternalism; social assistance; social citizenship; social construction of deservedness,"Since the early 21st century, the Chinese government has proactively expanded social protection by providing better benefits and broader coverage for its people. However, a new puzzle has emerged in the Minimum Living Standard Scheme, 'last resort of social protection' in China. Normally, when the benefit standard is set higher, relatively more people situated below this line are entitled to receive assistance. However, in reality fewer people than expected receive support. We study the case of Guangzhou, the capital of Guangdong Province, to explain this phenomenon and analyse the social citizenship of marginalized groups in urban China. We reveal the decline in replacement rates and tighter conditionality applied to defining the 'deserving poor' by reviewing administrative data and policy documents from 1995 to 2016. Drawing on the longitudinal qualitative study conducted between 2009 and 2011, we further illustrate how the decreased replacement rate and tighter conditionality diminish the well-being of the poor. Our findings on policy changes and their outcomes in Guangzhou provide some important insights into poverty governance and social citizenship under China's social development in the past decade."

Recent studies have argued that predictable corruption, in which bribers are guaranteed the delivery of government services, is less distortional and more efficiency-enhancing than arbitrary corruption in which officials engage in simple plunder. Yet the empirical evidence is mixed. By leveraging a vignette experiment embedded in an original firm survey in China, we find that overseas investors always consider corruption detrimental. There is some evidence that high-productivity and fixed-asset intensive investors might view predictable corruption more favorably than arbitrary corruption. Additionally, we find that compared to arbitrary corruption, predictable corruption is not associated with a significantly higher probability of market entry, but it increases the likelihood of majority ownership. Overall, the results provide little evidence that corruption ""greases the wheels of commerce"" even in a most likely case and suggest that the perceived benefits of predictable corruption are limited."

It is argued that while BRI could benefit from stronger China–Iran ties, Iran's international posturing has proven a significant hindrance to China, highlighting that entrenched patterns of engagement in Great Power-Middle Power relations are not easily shifted, even in the face of immense economic incentives."

We examined over 100 projects reported by the media and lists compiled by other organizations, amassing case studies for each project using desk research, interviews and field visits. We demonstrate that Chinese engagement in African hydropower is often overestimated in both numbers and value. Further, misunderstanding and myths abound regarding Chinese financing and construction practices. This evidence‐based understanding provides a firmer foundation for advocacy, research and efforts by other companies and funding agencies to co‐operate with Chinese actors in this controversial sector."

Drawing on desk research and interviews, it tests and validates the hypothesis that the key driving force for this development is the coupling of the financialisation of the Chinese economy and the politics of 'ecological civilisation', although learning through international interaction has also played a role. It further shows that the scope for the United Kingdom to benefit from this growth is limited by the structure of UK-China trade, China's strong macro-economic control and its approach to international relations that prioritises learning and identity transformation rather than the opening up of its markets. Inter-hub competition also plays a part."
Growing Up in (and Out of) Shenzhen: The Longer-Term Impacts of Rural-Urban Migration on Education and Labor Market Entry.,"Goodburn, Charlotte",China Journal,University of Chicago Press,RURAL-urban migration; LABOR market; EMIGRATION & immigration -- Social aspects; EDUCATION of children of migrant laborers; VOCATIONAL schools,,"Extensive research has shown that rural-to-urban migrant children in China face significant barriers to an urban public primary school education and often end up in poor-quality, migrant-run private schools. However, much less is known about what happens after children leave junior high school. This article therefore draws on two rounds of interviews with migrant children educated in Shenzhen, in 2008–9 and then in 2015–16, to examine in detail their experiences of schooling and labor-market entry. It identifies four distinct pathways of education—state vocational school, private migrant secondary school, state academic high school, and return to the countryside for further schooling—and suggests that these educational routes all ultimately lead to the same endpoint: regardless of pathway, aptitude, financial investment in education, and earlier career aspirations, migrant youths are channeled into low-skilled urban service work. This is in marked contrast to the hopes of parents that their children will achieve upward mobility through investment in education. This article analyzes the multiple reasons for the depressing uniformity of outcomes and the crucial role of state policy at both the central and local levels in perpetuating migrant disadvantage."

The article argues that Hainan has played three major roles in the SCS disputes: an avid defender of China's claim and position, an active definer of China's interests in the disputes, and a helpful participant in asserting China's national security in the SCS. The establishment of the Sansha city has significantly increased Hainan's involvement in the SCS contestations. This article concludes that Beijing's policy in the SCS is unlikely to become significantly more moderate partly because of Hainan's strong position on the dispute and keen interest in the resources in the area. The article also recommends incorporating the views and activities of local governments in future studies on Chinese foreign and security policy."

Yet a comparative study shows that regular armed forces prefer to avoid becoming involved in domestic conflicts—and China's PLA is no exception. Concentrating on Uyghur unrest, the article shows that most of the burden of maintaining internal security in China falls on para-military troops, primarily on the People's Armed Police Force, the Xinjiang Production-Construction Corps and the Militia, and on non-military outfits, such as the Police and internal security units. Maintaining internal security absorbs an increasing share of China's defense budget, so much so that in recent years Beijing conceals the figures."
Has democratic governance and the rule of law been compromised by the continued growth of the administrative state?,"Warren, Kenneth F.",Journal of Chinese Governance,Taylor & Francis Ltd,ADMINISTRATIVE acts; POLITICAL science; LEGISLATIVE power; UNITED States. Congress; SCHOLARS,administrative discretion; Administrative state; checks and balances; Chevron deference; delegation; democratic accountability; public administration; rule of law,"To place the administrative state into perspective, I first present the theoretical justifications for America's traditional form of government followed by the theoretical justifications for the administrative state, especially promoted by early public administration scholars. I then present the prevalent scholarly viewpoint that we live in an administrative state where public administrators exercise not only administrative powers, but legislative and judicial powers as well because Congress has irresponsibly delegated away vast legislative powers to agency administrators, while the courts have provided scant review by deferring too readily to administrative expertise. To these scholars, this has undermined our checks and balance system and violated the rule of law. Although there is considerable merit to this position, for the sake of providing some balance, I present a rather polemical, opposing argument. I hold that the administrative state notion distorts the true governing system in America because Congress, the courts, and the president are still viable players that have and can continue to provide, if necessary, sufficient checks on the administrative state. I provide the reasons why. I conclude by questioning whether we even have an administrative state, but even if so, I offer evidence to suggest that the administrative state is constitutionally sanctioned, politically legitimate, upholds the rule of law, and actually performs better than our traditional three governmental branches."

However, empirical evidence for this proposition is mixed. In this article, we clarify competing theories, elucidate their implications for public opinion, and describe the results of a series of survey experiments designed to evaluate whether and why there is a hawk's advantage. We find that hawks are indeed better positioned domestically to initiate rapprochement than doves. We also find support for two key causal mechanisms: Voters are more confident in rapprochement when it is pursued by a hawk and are more likely to view hawks who initiate conciliation as moderates. Further, the hawk's advantage persists whether conciliatory efforts end in success or failure. Our microfoundational evidence thus suggests a pronounced domestic advantage for hawks who deliver the olive branch."
Hedging in South Asia: balancing economic and security interests amid Sino-Indian competition.,"Lim, Darren J; Mukherjee, Rohan",International Relations of the Asia-Pacific,Oxford University Press / USA,COLLATERAL security; NATIONAL security; INTERNATIONAL economic relations; CHINA-United States relations; HEDGING (Finance),,"The literature on hedging as a secondary state strategy – built largely on evidence from United States-China competition in East and Southeast Asia – focuses on conditions where a major power presents both an economic opportunity and a security threat. In South Asia, in contrast, secondary states facing strategic competition between India and China have pursued hedging strategies in the absence of a security threat. We develop a theoretical reconciliation of these two phenomena. Hedging at its core involves a trade-off between the material benefits and autonomy costs of cooperating with a major power in a competitive environment. States are likely to hedge when these benefits and costs are simultaneously rising. We test the plausibility of this theory in the cases of the Maldives and Sri Lanka. The autonomy trade-off operates both in the absence and in the presence of a security threat, thus offering a theoretical advancement with greater empirical scope."
Hero or Villain?

Compared to many other historical figures, Shi Lang remains essential to our understanding of the cross-strait tension and the murky outlook for its future. Although the image of Shi Lang continues to mean different things to different individuals, to some degree, his significance to one particular community is also communicated to other communities. By analysing most of the previous appraisals and examinations of Shi Lang, we can reveal the historical narratives of this man as being continually under construction in a shifting and mutually reinforcing process. This article aims to examine the ways in which the legacy of Shi Lang has percolated throughout Chinese history, since the Qing dynasty, and also how it continues to function in the present day. It is fascinating to not only delineate how the story of Shi Lang has evolved as a legacy, but also to explore the rich variety of ways in which an individual or a community has adapted the narratives that make up the story of Shi Lang to suit the demands of different historical settings and perspectives."

This article explores the historical origin of this difference in the revolutionary periods. By analyzing the biographies of communist military elites, it argues that this discrepancy took shape before the revolutionary takeover and resulted from the differentiated intensities of warfare across Russia and China. In China, the numerous civil wars and military defeats, radicalized the old military structure and boosted societal militarization; thus, eroding the mutual exclusion between the military and revolutionaries. The effect was lesser in Tsarist Russia than in prerevolutionary China, making the old military a conservative and professional corporate that the Bolsheviks could not completely subordinate to Party control."

Why does historical ownership lead to more hardened bargaining stances than in other territorial disputes? Do such uncompromising positions lead to more military conflict? We investigate these questions in this study. After developing a theoretical argument for how historical ownership may lead to a perception of territorial indivisibility, we test the hypotheses derived from the theory with a survey experiment implemented in China. We find that a historical ownership treatment increases the number of respondents who view the indivisible outcome of a hypothetical dispute as the only acceptable outcome. Furthermore, those who perceive a territory to be indivisible are more likely to favor economic sanctions and military solutions to the dispute and are much less likely to support bilateral negotiation or arbitration by an international organization."

To understand fully the possibilities and limitations of China's foreign policy, it is important to see its occurrences within geopolitical contexts. The main argument of this article is that geopolitical context must be theorised in order to understand the decisions of states. We define a political geography perspective within a world-systems analysis that creates a Space–Time matrix of context based on the core–periphery hierarchy of the capitalist world economy and economic and hegemonic cycles. Inspired by Chinese scholars and policymakers' periodisations of Chinese diplomacy, we develop a new periodisation of Chinese diplomatic cycles from 1840 to 2039. Using this new periodisation of Chinese diplomacy, we situate the changing nature of Chinese foreign policy within our Space–Time matrix. We then evaluate the possibilities and challenges of China's current foreign policy, with emphasis on the Belt and Road Initiative, by illustrating features of the contemporary geopolitical context. Finally, we discuss the implications of this for contemporary Chinese foreign policy."

It surprisingly finds that ethnic minority women are less disadvantaged in the labour market than Han women. This is largely due to smaller penalties linked to marriage and having children."

The authors compare this measure to standard money-metric measures of poverty using a 15-year longitudinal study of children from 100 villages in Northwest China. Nearly a quarter of multi-context poor children are not income poor, while almost three-fourths of the income poor are not multi-context poor. Social and community deprivations are only weakly associated with 'money-metric' deprivations but are significantly linked with short and long-term welfare outcomes for children.

This question is critical for China–Hong Kong relations. However, few studies have explored it from a comparative perspective. This study compares Hong Kong and mainland college students' national identities by making a series of interlocked surveys and interviews from 2012 to 2016. It shows that Hong Kong students have a much lower sociopolitical identity with China, which proves to be the primary cause for their separatist tendencies. Although they hold a comparably strong pan-Chinese economic identity, it does not strengthen their sociopolitical identity as it does for mainland students. This can be attributed to their post-materialist framework through which they are unlikely to believe that economic development alone can bring sociopolitical improvements. The findings imply that China faces serious difficulties in turning its economic strength into political charm in societies with strong post-materialist values."

This study finds a non-linear relationship between happiness and the probability of financial market participation. The probability of risky financial market participation increases as self-reported happiness measure increases. However, the probability declines slightly at the highest level of self-reported happiness measure. In order to address a potential endogeneity problem, this study uses the Two Stage Least Squaredmodel with two sets of instrumental variables. These findings provide a strong support for the hypothesis that a person's subjective well-being is one of the major determinants of household's economic behaviours, and provide an important implication on household portfolio research."

This study investigates the effects of homeownership and housing wealth on people's subjective class identification in urban China. Using the data from the China Family Panel Studies (CFPS) from 2010 to 2016, we estimate fixed-effects models and show that growth in housing wealth improves people's perceived social status, and the improvement is greater in more economically developed areas with higher real estate prices and greater housing inequality. Owning a home enhances subjective social class only in eastern coastal regions but not in inland regions. These findings suggest that as homeownership expands and becomes universal in a society, the psychological benefits of homeownership may diminish, but the subjective impact of housing wealth would increase. The study contributes to the literature on the social consequences of housing in a transitional society that is experiencing rapid housing privatization and increased housing stratification."

Since the beginning of the ""Construction of the New Socialist Countryside"" project in 2005, the Chinese state has made great efforts to improve the living standards of rural populations, with a particular focus on the construction of ""comfortable"" and modern housing. This paper examines the housing subsidy projects that were launched in Amdo in 2009. Drawing on qualitative data, including participant observation and interviews, the paper examines the ways in which Tibetan villagers seek to achieve their versions of modernity through these projects. It analyzes how housing projects have encouraged villagers to become more avid market consumers by cultivating and increasing their desires for material improvement.

As for the national views, (1) American perceptions of China have generally become more negative than Chinese perceptions of America; (2) little congruence is found between the two powers on key values and norms; and (3) perceptions are generally getting far ahead of the realities. As for the official views, formal documents do not fully reveal their real state of minds. Diplomatic courtesy and strategic self-esteem runs through them. Yet, America's strategic concern and growing will to manage China from a position of strength is increasingly more discernible. From the Chinese documents, on the other hand, signs of inferiority have gradually disappeared. In sum, perceptions between the two are working more as a catalyst for strategic competition than a constraint on it."
How Artificial Intelligence is Reshaping Repression.,"Feldstein, Steven",Journal of Democracy,Johns Hopkins University Press,AUTHORITARIANISM; DEMOCRACY; ARTIFICIAL intelligence,,"Around the world, artificial-intelligence (AI) systems are showing their potential for abetting repressive regimes and upending the relationship between citizen and state, thereby accelerating a global resurgence of authoritarianism. China is driving the proliferation of AI technology to authoritarian and illiberal regimes, an approach that has become a key component of Chinese geopolitical strategy. The significance of this technology for authoritarians around the globe, as well as for their democratic opponents, is growing ever clearer. To counter not only the spread of high-tech repression abroad, but also potential abuses at home, policy makers in democratic states must think seriously about how to mitigate harm and to shape better practices."

Though the Chinese government tends to follow a bilateral rather than collective approach to consolidate its regional security stance for the time being, one can expect China to push forward an all‐inclusive and comprehensive platform for enhanced collective security. Yet China will not pursue a completely new security order to replace the old one. Instead, it is taking a pragmatic and incremental approach to shape the necessary environment for the evolution of the US‐led hegemonic order into a more pluralistic, inclusive, and comprehensive one, where peace and security are guaranteed through closer political consultation and more integrated economic and social development among regional countries. If Sino‐US relations can be well managed and China keeps projecting its growing power in a restrained and contributive way to provide more public goods for regional peace and development, then one can hope for an Asia‐Pacific security community to take shape in the coming decades."

Multi-dimensional interdependence between Japan and China has been proceeding rapidly as one of the most positive factors in terms of pushing forward the bilateral relationship for the long run. However, emotions among the public from the two sides are problematic and uncertain, and it is crucial to investigate how to ""normalize"" people-to-people emotions. Contingency events, which tend to lead to inward-looking, and to narrow nationalism, always undermine Japan-China relations. The ""Nationalization"" crisis in 2012 is one of the typical cases from which the two nations should absorb the lessons deliberately. A lack of facts and truthful information, failure of diplomatic communication, simultaneously rising nationalism and declining governance capability and transforming power balance in the Asia-Pacific region created the crisis over the uninhabited islands. How Japan and China can overcome these dilemmas and manage the complicated bilateral relationship more effectively? Beyond continuously promoting multi-dimensional interdependence, the two sides have to establish channels and mechanisms of crisis management in order to avoid the bilateral relationship being constantly threatened by the occurrence of contingency events and rampant, irresponsible nationalism."
How dams climb mountains: China and India's state-making hydropower contest in the Eastern-Himalaya watershed.,"Gamble, Ruth",Thesis Eleven,"Sage Publications, Ltd.",ENVIRONMENTAL degradation; SOVEREIGNTY; NATION-state; HIMALAYA Mountains; WATERSHEDS; WATER power,borders; development; environmental degradation; Himalaya; hydropower; state-making,"The dam rush in the upper-Brahmaputra River basin and local, minority resistance to it are the result of complex geopolitical and parochial causes. India and China's competing claims for sovereignty over the watershed depend upon British and Qing Dynasty imperial precedents respectively. And the two nation-states have extended and enhanced their predecessors' claims on the area by continuing to erase local sovereignty, enclose the commons, and extract natural resources on a large scale. Historically, the upper basin's terrain forestalled the thorough integration of this region into both nation-states, but recent technological and economic advances have enabled the two states and their agents to dramatically transformed these landscapes. Many of their projects have perpetuated the interventionist hydrological regimes that India and China also inherited from their imperial forebears. Nevertheless, as with their definition of their borders, neither state has highlighted this historical contingency. Instead, both governments have consistently presented their hydropower projects as shining examples of necessary and benevolent development. Their economy-focused, monolithic development paradigms have, not coincidently, also enabled the systemic sidelining of non-majority cultures, religions and histories. The combination of this cultural exclusion and the nation-states' late integration of this peripheral region has laid the ground for conflict with local groups over the dam rush. Local identities and experiences have evolved around complex religious, cultural and trade networks, many of which were heavily influenced by the now-defunct Tibetan polity, rather than via modern Chinese and Indian nationalist discourses of development. The dam clashes highlight both the basin's complex cultural matrixes and the ambiguous relationship Asia's two most populous nation-states have with their respective imperial pasts. And as the situation remains unresolved, the watershed is an ecological catastrophe in waiting."
How Do Firms in the Private Sector Perceive Constraints to Doing Business in China?,"Wang, Miao; Zhuang, Hong",Global Economic Review,Taylor & Francis Ltd,FOREIGN investments; FOREIGN ownership of business enterprises; GOVERNMENT business enterprises; WORLD Bank; ECONOMIC conditions in China; CHINA,Business environment; China; firm perceptions; foreign direct investment; indigenous firms,"This paper studies perceptions of business constraints in China using rich firm-level data from the 2005 and 2012 World Bank Enterprise Surveys conducted jointly by the China National Bureau of Statics and the World Bank. In addition, we focus on the variations of perceptions across foreign and indigenous Chinese firms. Our results show that there exist significant differences in perceptions between foreign and domestic firms in China in the 2005 survey, but such differences are no long present in the 2012 survey. Our analysis also identifies several elements perceived as more severe constraints by both domestic and foreign firms."

However, most survey research on Chinese public opinion on international affairs has looked at measures of nationalist identity rather than beliefs about foreign policy and evaluations of the government's performance. Five surveys of Chinese citizens, netizens, and elites help illuminate the attitudes that the Chinese government grapples with in managing international security policy. The results suggest that Chinese attitudes are more hawkish than dovish and that younger Chinese, while perhaps not more nationalist in identity, may be more hawkish in their foreign policy beliefs than older generations. Netizens and elites are even more inclined to call on the Chinese government to invest in and rely more on military strength."
How innovation impacts firms' export survival: Does export mode matter?,"Dai, Meihong; Liu, Haiyang; Lin, Lingtao",World Economy,Wiley-Blackwell,FOREIGN investments; EXPORTS; CHINA; PROPENSITY score matching; SURVIVAL; EXPORT marketing,export survival; firm; innovation,"The innovation‐export nexus has been extensively explored, while relatively few studies have focused on innovation's impact on firms' export survival and the role of export mode. Using a large panel dataset from China, this research empirically explores how innovation impacts firms' export survival, considering export modes. First, we employ the discrete‐time survival analysis model (cloglog) to examine this research addressing the censored issue. Second, the propensity score matching (PSM) methodology is employed to address the selection‐bias issue and select the similar firms based on which to compare their Kaplan–Meier survivor probability. Results present a positive role of innovation in the export survival of direct exporters; however, there is an inverted‐U relationship between innovation intensity and their survival probability. For indirect exporters, evidence shows an insignificant innovation‐export survival nexus. In addition, results show higher export survival for Chinese innovative exporters who are foreign‐owned, highly export‐intensive, long‐lasting in export market, in technology industries. For innovative exporters who export directly, those in medium and low‐technological industries and export capital goods are more likely to survive. Our research provides insights for Chinese exporters regarding innovation participation and suggests the government conducting prudent and deliberate design for innovation strategy."
How Is Public Housing Policy Implemented in China? A Tentative Analysis of the Local Implementation of Four Major Programs.,"Fan, Yongmao; Yang, Hongshan",American Review of Public Administration,Sage Publications Inc.,PUBLIC housing; LABOR incentives; LOCAL government; IMPLEMENTATION (Social action programs); SIGNS & symbols,China; incentive mechanism; local implementation; policy path; public housing,"One challenge that policy implementation studies face is how to build a structural framework using different variables. This article constructs a path-incentive model of implementation as an analytical framework with which to examine the relationship between central and local government. It consists of two key variables: policy path and incentive. The model embraces four types of implementation: administrative implementation, experimental implementation, flexible implementation, and symbolic implementation. Based on a case study of China's major public housing policies from 1998 to 2013, the article finds that even if policy goals and the implementation path are sometimes unclear, a strong top-down incentive mechanism will encourage local governments to actively engage in policy experiments. This local explorative approach can enhance an understanding of the policy environment and avoid apportioning blame to the central government for defective policy making. In China, policy implementation not only turns policy goals into real outcomes but also is a means of improving policy paths and incentive mechanisms."
HOW PUBLIC OPINION SHAPES TAIWAN'S SUNFLOWER MOVEMENT.,"Wu, Charles K.S.",Journal of East Asian Studies,Cambridge University Press,PUBLIC opinion; POLICY sciences; SOCIAL movements; DECISION making; TAIWAN,cross-Strait relations; public opinion; social movements,"The 2014 Sunflower Movement succeeded in blocking Taiwan's Congress from ratifying the Cross-Strait Services Trade Agreement (CSSTA), a bill that proposed to liberalize trade with China. Since most of the participants in this movement were students and NGO members, they had limited economic and political resources to influence policy change, which makes their success in stopping a trade deal remarkable. Many attribute this important success to an elite alliance with politicians inside the government, fueled by a personal rivalry between political elites. However, I argue that changing public opinion is the more important force behind the creation of the alliance. With original data from interviews with political elites, their staff members, and activists in Taiwan, in addition to secondary information, I confirm public opinion to be the major reason for the political alliance. This case illustrates that in some circumstances, public opinion outweighs the importance of elite rivalry in influencing political elite decision-making, and it could represent a key mechanism of democratic policy-making."
How Rising Powers Create Governance Gaps: The Case of Export Credit and the Environment.,"Hopewell, Kristen",Global Environmental Politics,MIT Press,EXPORT credit; INTERNATIONAL economic relations; BRICS countries; INTERNATIONAL Monetary Fund; DEVELOPING countries,,"This article analyzes how rising powers are affecting an important area of global governance at the intersection of trade and environment: export credit. State-backed export credit agencies (ECAs) play a major role in financing large infrastructure and energy projects, particularly in developing countries. Many of these projects carry significant environmental implications, yet there has been little scholarly attention to their governance. Since the 1990s, global governance of the environmental practices of ECAs has been progressively expanded and strengthened via the OECD Arrangement on export credit and Common Approaches for environmental and social due diligence. Recently, however, there has been a dramatic increase in export credit provision by rising powers, such as India and China, who are not members of the OECD nor subject to the Arrangement or Common Approaches. In this article, I argue that existing governance mechanisms have not caught up with the rapidly changing landscape of export credit. Drawing on the case of India's financing for the Rampal coal-fired power plant in Bangladesh, I show that the problem of environmental governance for export credit increasingly extends beyond the advanced-industrialized states of the OECD. The failure to cover the large and growing volume of export credit provided by the emerging powers represents a major gap in the established system of environmental governance for export credit."

How do Chinese scholars interact with the government and how does the détente on the Korean Peninsula influence the opinion market of the academic community of China? How should South Korea handle the relationship with Chinese scholars in order to meet its own interests? In this article, I analyze the interaction between Chinese academics and politics on the basis of information available to the public and the changes in China's policy toward the Peninsula during and after the Sino-US trade conflict."

Classical conceptions of political virtue, which can be found in both Chinese (Confucian) and Western (Aristotelian) traditions, provide a background for understanding human dignity and thus offer some guidance for this contemporary task."

They advocated the use of non-violent civil disobedience to fight for universal suffrage and genuine election of the Chief Executive in Hong Kong. Though the Umbrella Movement did not end up in successfully changing the electoral system of Hong Kong, its impact on students, academics and the civil society was far beyond the few months of occupation. At the same time, activist scholars had to pay the price for their political activism outside the academia. This paper reflects on the experience of activist scholars in the Umbrella Movement, evaluates their roles in pursuing social change, the challenges they faced, and their impact on students, the academia, and the civil society."

Humanitarianism from the Suburbs: Australian Refugee Relief and Activism during the 1971 Bangladeshi Liberation War.,"Stevens, Rachel",Australian Journal of Politics & History,Wiley-Blackwell,"HUMANITARIANISM; WAR casualties; LOBBYING; ACTIVISM; BANGLADESH Revolution, 1971",,"The Bangladesh Liberation War against West Pakistan in 1971 triggered an exodus of ten million refugees, the deaths of approximately 1.5 million people and widespread destruction of villages, crops and infrastructure. Preoccupied with the Cold War and domestic politics, powerful nations such as the US and UK did not intervene directly and reluctantly provided aid. The Australian government, for its part, was particularly slow to offer aid, trailing efforts of New Zealand and most Western European governments. While the McMahon administration remained indifferent, Australians from diverse backgrounds engaged with this conflict by raising public awareness, fundraising and lobbying the Australian government to increase its aid contribution to Bangladeshis displaced by war. At a time when Australian government policies focused on the war in Indo‐China, Cold War politics and development in south‐east Asia and the south Pacific, I consider the ways Australian individuals offered aid to Asian, non‐Christian refugees, some of whom held Maoist views. Using archival materials, historical newspapers and census data, this article argues that, paradoxically, it was individuals with little political capital who spearheaded Australian efforts to aid Bangladeshi refugees. In short, the Bangladesh Liberation War provoked a groundswell of suburban activism that acted independently of government policies."

Yet, the utility of the hybrid label is often contested in security studies. A problem relates to how the concept of hybrid warfare has been extended to cases that have little in common with the cases from which the concept was originally derived. This article suggests making a conceptual distinction between hybrid warfare and hybrid interference. The article is devoted to developing this latter, new strategic concept. In essence, hybrid interference is conceptualized as a 'wedge strategy', namely a policy of dividing a target country or coalition, thereby weakening its counterbalancing potential. By drawing particularly on recent practices by China and Russia, the article shows how hybrid interference uses a panoply of state-controlled, non-kinetic means, which are more or less concealed in order to provide the divider with plausible deniability and to control targeted actors without elevating their threat perceptions. Three main bundles of means are central to hybrid interference: 1) clandestine diplomacy; 2) geoeconomics; and 3) disinformation. The article shows how western democracies are vulnerable to hybrid interference. Hybrid interference makes use of the liberal values that characterize western democracy, exploiting them as opportunities to drive wedges through democratic societies and undermine governability. The article argues that this sort of external interference has been overlooked in the debate on democratic deconsolidation, that it is becoming more common, and discusses some counter-measures to defend against it."

The provisioning of institutionalized state schooling, in particular, has all along been part and parcel of these development projects, including urbanization and resettlement initiatives. However, for a variety of reasons, the promotion of schooling in Tibetan pastoral areas has been a challenge since the first Maoist efforts in 1950s. By focusing on a case study of a Buddhist monk's persistent effort to build a primary school in his home village in the eastern region of Tibet in 1990, and on how Tibetan villagers' views of him and his school project have changed over time, this paper examines the nexus of relationships between schooling, and social and cultural changes in pastoral Tibet. I also aim to relate Tibetan pastoralists' shifting values of schooling to the larger social and political context, particularly the ubiquitous Chinese xiangmu (project) economy and Tibetan pastoralists' ever-increasing dependence on the state. This paper argues that although state schooling is highly contested, it has been one of the driving forces of social change in Tibetan pastoral areas today."

Images of International Politics in Chinese Science Fiction: Liu Cixin's Three-Body Problem.,"Dyson, Stephen Benedict",New Political Science,Taylor & Francis Ltd,"WORLD politics; POLITICAL science; THREE-body problem; SCIENCE fiction; LIU Cixin, 1963-",,"Scholars are increasingly exploring the links between the other worlds of science fiction and theorizations of our own reality. This article extends the scope of political science fiction studies by focusing on the Chinese author Liu Cixin's Three-Body novels, thus incorporating a key non-Western work. I interrogate the Three-Body series through the lens of Kenneth N. Waltz's three images of international relations, recovering the abundant homologies across the texts. Both writers represent human nature as malevolent, are skeptical of the importance of domestic politics, and place most weight on the logic of survival perpetuated by an international/interstellar system. They share meta-theoretical commitments too, each stating that global/galactic politics must be interpreted rather than observed. Yet the final pages of Liu's text destabilize the apparently copacetic relationship with Waltzian thought. Liu reveals his interstellar system to be created rather than given, and subject to positive transformation through the acts of agents. Liu's final move calls into question statist, positivist, and zero-sum premises about our contemporary world order by suggesting that they, too, are created by powerful actors rather than being scientific givens. The implications for our practice of politics are clear."
Immigrant influx and generational politics: A comparative case study of Hong Kong and Taiwan.,"Wong, Stan Hok-Wui; Lee, Kuan-Chen; Ho, Karl; Clarke, Harold D.",Electoral Studies,Elsevier B.V.,IMMIGRANTS; EMIGRATION & immigration; PRACTICAL politics; ELECTIONS; HONG Kong (China),Attitudes toward immigrants; China; Generational politics; Immigration; Party identification; Vote choice,"Abstract Studies have long shown the existence of an age gap in voting behavior. We argue that the influx of immigrants can influence the size of this gap. Young people can become more apprehensive toward immigrants than older people because of the former's greater exposure to more competition from immigrants in the labor market and susceptibility to anti-immigrant sentiments in society. The age gap in attitudes toward immigrants can carry over to vote choice. We illustrate our argument with a comparative study of Hong Kong and Taiwan. While the two societies share many similarities, Hong Kong has experienced a significantly larger influx of immigrants from mainland China. Based on two election surveys in 2016, we find a distinct generational gap in attitudes toward immigrants in Hong Kong, but not in Taiwan. The age gap in Hong Kong also manifests itself in electoral support of China-resisting political parties."

It also helps China address its 'trust deficit' problem. While both operations seem 'low hanging fruit' for international cooperation, the ways in which China undertakes peacekeeping and HADR cooperation differ – the former encompasses not only cooperation for technical and capacity development but also cooperation for policy harmonisation, while China's HADR cooperation is limited to technical and capacity development. This paper asks, 'why the difference?', despite the fact that they both address similar policy problems. It argues that the difference corresponds to the level of holisticity/fragmentation of China's decision-making process. The more holistic China's decision-making process, the deeper the international cooperation. The nature of China's decision-making processes has international policy implications, because the fragmented nature of those processes maintains cooperation at a functional level only, and hinders the deeper development of cooperation into policy harmonisation."
Impact of Economic Development Levels and Disaster Types on the Short-Term Macroeconomic Consequences of Natural Hazard-Induced Disasters in China.,"Tang, Rumei; Wu, Jidong; Ye, Mengqi; Liu, Wenhui",International Journal of Disaster Risk Science,Springer Nature,NATURAL disasters; ECONOMIC development; ECONOMIC impact; PANEL analysis; RURAL development; DISASTERS; CHINA,China; Disaster types; Macroeconomic growth; Regional development,"The relationship between natural hazard-induced disasters and macroeconomic growth has been examined widely on global and national scales, but little research has been focused on the subnational level, especially in China. We examined the impacts of natural hazard-induced disasters on the regional growth in China based on subnational panel data for the period from 1990 to 2016. First, we used the number of people affected and the direct economic losses as the measures of the scale of disasters. Then, we used the direct damages of meteorological disasters and earthquakes as disaster measures separately to examine the impacts of different disaster types. Finally, we performed intraregional effects regressions to observe the spatial heterogeneity within the regions. The results show that the adverse short-term effects of disasters is most pronounced in the central region, while the direct damage of disasters is a positive stimulus of growth in the whole of China. However, this stimulus is observed in a lagged way and is reflected differently—meteorological disasters in central and eastern China and earthquakes in western China are related to regional growth. The results demonstrate that the short-term macroeconomic impacts of these disasters in the three geographical regions of China largely depend on regional economic development levels and the disaster types."

This article integrates environmental decentralization into an environmental/economic analytical framework, introducing a fiscal decentralization indicator to explore the mechanism of environmental decentralization and regional green development, and then tests this concept using Chinese provincial penal data. The results show that the spillover effect of green development is significant: Improving regional green development will promote green development in neighboring regions. At the national level, different categories of environmental decentralization have different effects, and these can also affect green development through both direct and indirect paths. There is also a positive interaction mechanism between these two variables. Moreover, the interaction between environmental and fiscal decentralization has a negative effect on regional green development, with the impact varying across regions. These findings play an important role in green development, industrial transformation, and advancement, especially in China."

In this article, we present the results of an intermediary assessment of the main socioeconomic consequences of the so-called 'deal of the century'. Additionally, we also provide relevant evidence about China's resource-financed infrastructure (RFI) model, which is key to determining China's potential role as a valuable strategic partner in building a better future for Africa. This analysis compares objectives and evidence in the main areas of the agreement: mining production, infrastructure, debt, economic growth and development. The appraisal has been carried out on the basis of a combination of evaluation tools, relying on extensive data collection from the most relevant DRC and international sources. In addition, several data sources have been checked to mitigate the unreliability of statistics and relevant qualitative information has been included with the objective of going beyond quantitative statistics. We conclude that in this first decade the Sicomines deal has not had the beneficial socio-economic consequences that were promised; the evidence shows that the DRC is exchanging part of its mineral wealth for deficient roads and poor equipment. This is a relevant conclusion since the outcomes of major pioneer RFI initiatives such as Sicomines may well determine the success of China's new financing and development paradigm in Africa."
Impact of the China–Pakistan Economic Corridor on Nation-Building in Pakistan.,"Ahmed, Zahid Shahab",Journal of Contemporary China,Taylor & Francis Ltd,INTERNATIONAL economic relations; GEOPOLITICS; ECONOMIC development; FOREIGN investments; CHINA -- Foreign relations; PAKISTAN -- Foreign relations,,"Since the beginning of bilateral ties in 1950, the China–Pakistan relationship has grown significantly. Known as Pakistan's 'all-weather friend', bilateral economic cooperation has been advanced by the China–Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) agreement, worth US$62 billion of Chinese investment in Pakistan. Due to its geo-economic and geopolitical importance, the CPEC is considered a 'game changer' by Beijing and Islamabad. However, since its initiation in 2015, the CPEC has also been a source of tension between centre and provincial governments in Pakistan. This paper analyses the impact of the CPEC on nation-building in Pakistan. In the light of nation-building theories, it further argues that the CPEC has provided Pakistan with much-needed opportunities to address inter-provincial and federal–provincial discord through dialogue and compromises."
Impacting Factors of the Chinese Military Enterprises' Capital Structure and Approaches of Importing Private Capital.,"Guo, Jianhao; Zhao, Chunkai",Defence & Peace Economics,Taylor & Francis Ltd,FOREIGN investments; MILITARY discipline; CHINA; CAPITAL structure; CHINESE military; ECONOMIC indicators; SMALL business,capital structure; Civil–military integration; financial indicators; military enterprise; private capital,"This paper analyzes the impacting factors of the capital structure of military listed companies in China, based on the 2001–2015 panel data of 104 Chinese listed companies, and we explore practical approaches for Chinese private capital entering the military enterprises, given the strategy of the civil–military integration. We show that: (1) state-owned shares and domestic legal person shares negatively impact the capital structure of military enterprises and mainly show in non-current liability. While the foreign legal person shares and the shareholding ratio of executives and managers have no significant impact. (2) As for the financial indicators, coefficients of firm size, asset tangibility, and growth are positive, while those of profitability, non-debt tax shield, and growth opportunity are negative. (3) Given the civil–military integration strategy, equity financing imposes a negative impact on the capital structure of military enterprises. The negative impact increases, with the increase in military enterprises' profitability, business risk, and growth opportunities, and with the decrease in military enterprises' growth and firm size. (4) The negative impacts of equity financing are significant, if debt ratios of the military enterprises are too small or too large. While the state-owned shares only have significant negative impact on military enterprises whose debt ratios are too small. As a conclusion, we suggest private capital to prioritize the corporate bonds or short-term borrowing to enter the military industry, and choose smaller or medium-sized military enterprises with more growth opportunities and lower business risks."
Impacts of Ownership Balance and Nonexecutive Directors on Bank Performance and Risk Taking: Evidence from City Commercial Banks in China.,"Zhou, Fangzhao; Fu, Yajing; An, Yunbi; Yang, Jun",Global Economic Review,Taylor & Francis Ltd,STOCKHOLDERS; BANKRUPTCY; BANKING industry; FINANCIAL risk; FINANCIAL performance,bank performance; Mixed ownership; nonexecutive director; ownership balance; risk taking,"This paper investigates the impacts of nongovernmental stake, ownership balance, and nonexecutive directors on bank performance and risk taking in city commercial banks (CCBs) in China. We find that ownership balance can improve CCBs' financial performance and reduce their bankruptcy risk as well as nonperforming loan level. Nonexecutive directors can help reduce bankruptcy risk, but have no significant effect on performance or nonperforming loans. The impacts of ownership balance and nonexecutive directors become more prominent when the nongovernmental stake is relatively high, suggesting that mixed ownership reform can promote bank performance and risk control via these two avenues."

Implementing liberal arts education in the era of the Fourth Industrial Revolution: lessons and implications for Korea's higher education policy.,"Lee, Yongmo; Moon, Grace Gesoon; Kwon, Young-Kook",International Review of Public Administration,Taylor & Francis Ltd,EDUCATION policy; SOUTH Korea; SINGAPORE; HUMANISTIC education; INDUSTRY 4.0; HIGHER education; NEUROPLASTICITY; FLUENCY (Language learning); EMOTIONAL intelligence,Fourth Industrial Revolution; higher education; innovation; liberal arts education,"This paper addresses the role of higher education in the looming era of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Though some believe that the exponential pace of technological advancement will make traditional higher education obsolete and replace it with lifelong microlearning and upskilling models, research shows that what will empower future generations to thrive in the new age of machines is not up-to-date technical fluency but such distinctly human traits as creative problem-solving, critical thinking, cognitive flexibility, cultural agility, and emotional intelligence. The key to cultivating these soft 'human' skills, the paper contends, lies in liberal arts education. To illustrate how a well-designed liberal arts curriculum can develop the capacities demanded of the future workforce, the paper presents brief case studies of liberal arts programs in Singapore and China. The paper concludes with a discussion of the challenges and policy directions for implementing liberal arts education in Korea's higher education system."

It argues that, in a climate thick with Sinophobia and fears of communism, but largely devoid of actual Chinese Reds, anticommunism for the Chinese was only secondarily about rooting out subversives, ideological authenticity, and supporting Chiang Kai-shek's counterattack against mainland China. As a social phenomenon, it was primarily a diverse and flexible repertoire of practices, from crime to civic associationism, that Chinese elites and their challengers employed to bolster their reputations as anticommunists, enrich themselves, and pursue vendettas against their 'communist' enemies. By focusing on these practices of what I call ideological accommodation, the article intervenes in scholarship on the Chinese diaspora after the Second World War by showing that anticommunism was essential to how the overseas Chinese adapted to being resident 'aliens' in post-colonial Philippine society."
In the Name of the Working Class: Narratives of Labour Activism in Contemporary China.,"Franceschini, Ivan; Sorace, Christian",Pacific Affairs,Pacific Affairs,LABOR movement; CIVIL society; COLLECTIVE bargaining; NONGOVERNMENTAL organizations; CHINESE Communist Party,China; civil society; collective bargaining; labour activism; labour NGOs,"Since their appearance in the mid-1990s, Chinese labour NGOs have mostly focused on disseminating labour law and guiding labour disputes through official channels. In so doing, they have assisted the Chinese Communist Party in achieving its paramount goal of maintaining social stability. In line with this approach, activists in these organizations have traditionally framed their work in terms of ""public interest"" or ""legality,"" both of which resonate with the hegemonic discourses of the Party-state. However, earlier this decade a minority of Chinese labour activists began to employ some new counterhegemonic narratives centred on the experience of the labour movement and the practice of collective bargaining that attempted to recode the proletarian experience outside of its official representation. In this paper we analyze this discursive shift through the voices of the activists involved, and argue that the rise of these new counterhegemonic voices was one of the reasons that led to the Party-state cracking down on labour NGOs."

This article fills this gap by investigating whether and how this rivalry affects a country's response to the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB). The findings of this article indicate that certain aspects of bilateral strategic ties indeed have strong effects on a country's reaction to the Chinese bank. More specifically, shorter distance to higher a level of partnership with, and more arms purchase from Beijing lead to faster accession to the AIIB, while the shorter distance to Washington results in slower accession, controlling for other factors. In addition, economically developed countries appear to be consistently more eager to join the Beijing-led bank than economically underdeveloped countries."

What is the likelihood that China and the United States will fall into the Thucydides Trap, meaning that the two countries will fight a major war during a potential power transition? This article creates a framework of seven variables, derived from dominant international relations theories and Graham Allison's ""twelve clues for peace,"" that predict the likelihood of major conflict between a rising and an established power: degree of economic interdependence, degree of institutional constraints, domestic political system, nature of relevant alliances, nature of nuclear weapons programs, the sustainability of the rising power's growth, and its level of dissatisfaction. It then evaluates the values of these variables in the context of the U.S.-China relationship to determine whether pessimism about the prospects of peace is warranted. This analysis leads to more mixed conclusions about the prospects of peace than liberal international relations theory and Allison's twelve clues would suggest. This research further operationalizes power transition theory and has practical implications for U.S. policy toward China."
Independent Freshman Admission Program (IFAP) in China's Higher Education: Evidence from Three National Elite Universities in Beijing.,"Wu, Xiaogang; Li, Zhonglu; Wang, Nan",Chinese Sociological Review,Taylor & Francis Ltd,HIGHER education -- China; UNIVERSITY & college admission; COLLEGE student recruitment; COLLEGE freshmen; COLLEGE students -- China,,"As one of the important reforms on the college admission, the Independent Freshman Admission Program (IFAP) has received wide attention since its implementation. Although there has been much discussion that IFAP has excerbated inequity in allocating educational opportunities, there is still a lack of empirical evidence as to whether or not such inequality is a necessary tradeoff to the recruitment of students with special talents. This article analzyes the subsample data of three national elite universities (Peking University, Tsinghua University, and Renmin University of China) from the Beijing College Student Panel Survey (BCSPS) to examine the consequence of the IFAP program in educational equity and outcomes, paying special attention to the heterogeneity of students recruited through the IFAP. We divide these students into two subgroups: those who could pass the entrance exam even without IFAP, and those who could be admitted only through the IFAP, and compare them to those who enter college through the competitive College Entrance Examination (gaokao). Results show that, the IFAP is socially stratified, and students selected by the IFAP more likely come from urban families, with college-educated parents, and graduated from key-point high schools. On the other hand, there is no significant difference between students selected through the IFAP and through regular gaokao in academic performance, social activities, non-cognitive skills, career planning and job placements after graduation. The implications of these findings for the reform on admission policies and procedures are discussed."

India's Counter-Terrorism Diplomacy Towards China: Issues and Trends.,"Kaura, Vinay",IUP Journal of International Relations,IUP Publications,"COUNTERTERRORISM; INTERNATIONAL relations; ASEAN; GREAT Britain. Joint Intelligence Committee; MODI, Narendra, 1950-",,"India's policy towards China has been to limit military tensions on the contested border through expanded bilateral economic engagement, high-level political contacts and enhanced multilateral cooperation on international issues. Counter-terrorism diplomacy is one such instrument, which has been viewed by India as an important diplomatic tool to convince China about the dangers of terrorism emanating from Pakistan. But China's uncooperative attitude towards India by repeatedly undermining the Modi government's diplomatic efforts to pressurize Pakistan has raised serious doubts about India's counter-terror diplomatic engagement with China. For India, the main source of terrorism is Pakistan. For China, Pakistan is its all-weather friend. Beijing's selective characterization of terrorist threat poses several challenges to the success of India's counter-terrorism efforts. Consequently, India has not been able to cope with Pakistan's asymmetric strategy of using terrorism, as Pakistan continues to mobilize China's unconditional help to ward off India's pressure."

Indonesia and the ASEAN outlook on the Indo-Pacific.,"Anwar, Dewi Fortuna",International Affairs,Oxford University Press / USA,"INTERNATIONAL relations; INTERNATIONAL cooperation; INDO-Pacific Region; ASEAN; INDONESIAN politics & government; JOKO Widodo, 1961-",Indo-Pacific; Indonesia; regional organization,"Indonesia has taken a leadership role within the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in drafting a common outlook on the Indo-Pacific concept. The widening of Indonesia's geostrategic canvas from the Asia–Pacific to the Indo-Pacific is in line with President Joko Widodo's intent to make Indonesia a Global Maritime Fulcrum (GMF). In view of the rivalry between the US and China and the emergence of various Indo-Pacific initiatives from other countries, Indonesia believes that ASEAN must try to maintain its centrality. The draft of Indonesia's perspective for an ASEAN outlook on the Indo-Pacific: towards a peaceful, prosperous, and inclusive region was submitted for considerations by ASEAN, and after 18 months of intensive lobbying by Indonesia the concept was finally adopted at the ASEAN Summit in June 2019. The ASEAN outlook promotes the principles of openness, inclusiveness, transparency, respect for international law and ASEAN centrality in the Indo-Pacific region. It proposes a building-block approach, seeking commonalities between existing regional initiatives in which ASEAN-led mechanisms will act as a fulcrum for both norm-setting and concrete cooperation. Rather than creating a new regional architecture, the East Asia Summit (EAS) is proposed as the platform for advancing the Indo-Pacific discourse and cooperation. Indonesia's ASEAN outlook on the Indo-Pacific marks its renewed foreign policy activism as a middle power and underlines the continuing importance that Indonesia places on ASEAN as the cornerstone of its foreign policy, emphasising ASEAN's centrality as the primary vehicle for managing relations with the major powers in the Indo-Pacific region."

Analysis is threefold – Indonesia's actorness in the Indo-Pacific, its strategic discourse on the Indo-Pacific, and its Indo-Pacific diplomacy. Actorness is pursued with regard to Indonesia's more active involvement in regional and subregional structures in the Indian Ocean and Pacific Ocean. Strategic discourse is threefold – Natalegawa's ""Indo-Pacific Treaty"" concept (2013–2014), Widodo's ""maritime nexus"" drive (2014 onwards), and the current ""Indo-Pacific Cooperation Concept"" (IPCC; 2018 onwards). Diplomacy is pursued with regard to Indonesia's relationship with Australia, Japan, China, India, and the United States. The article concludes that while Indonesia certainly is on the rise as an Indo-Pacific actor, its continuing naval weakness undermines Indonesia's ""maritime nexus"" stance, while its reluctance to challenge China leaves Indonesia's Indo-Pacific Treaty and its IPCC vague and to some degree ignoring uncomfortable security issues posed by China. A closer synergy for Indonesia with the US and Japanese Free and Open Indo-Pacific initiative is suggested."

In recent years, Indonesia under the administration of President Joko Widodo has played a strategic role in maintaining regional stability in the Indo-Pacific amid inflaming tensions between the two countries. On the basis of an ""independent and active"" foreign policy with Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) at the center of a concentric circle, Indonesia has employed a hedging strategy to bolster regional stability and foster cooperation among countries in the region. While there may be room for a hedging strategy, it is important to understand how Indonesia has employed this strategy to shape the regional order. This paper argues that Indonesia has adopted a double hedging strategy of economic pragmatism on the one hand and limited bandwagoning on the other. The former includes a deepening of economic cooperation with China through collaboration between Indonesia's vision of a Global Maritime Fulcrum and China's Belt and Road Initiative. The latter includes keeping the US involved in the Indo-Pacific by proposing its Indo-Pacific concept to regional players without challenging the existing proposals offered by major powers. This paper consists of four sections. The first section introduces the theoretical basis by focusing on Indonesia's foreign policy ideas as it deals with competition between great powers. The second section discusses the synthesis of Indonesia's vision of a Global Maritime Fulcrum and concept of the Indo-Pacific. The third section demonstrates how Indonesia has employed its double hedging strategy. The fourth section highlights the conclusions of this study by summarizing Indonesia's response to competition between the US and China and providing recommendations for further research."

Indonesia's South China Sea diplomacy has been one such area of autonomy. Although the issue has gained great public salience, as the most prominent foreign policy challenge for the current Joko Widodo administration, the government has maintained a striking continuity in its approach dating to the authoritarian Suharto era. Such continuity persists because the strategic challenge facing Indonesia has endured: throughout Indonesia's modern history, the government has sought to assert the nation's rights to territory and resources against more powerful states. The government's current policy settings have also preserved a status quo that serves a range of Indonesian interests sufficiently well to prevent the emergence of a coherent coalition of interests to push for a new approach, in what is a technical policy area dominated by foreign ministry experts. As such, although the Joko Widodo administration has exhibited greater overt nationalism in its handling of the issue, Indonesia's broader illiberal turn has not been transformative of the government's diplomacy."
Indonesia's swift securitization of the Natuna Islands how Jakarta countered China's claims in the South China Sea.,"Meyer, Patrik Kristhope; Nurmandi, Achmad; Agustiyara, Agustiyara",Asian Journal of Political Science,Taylor & Francis Ltd,TERRITORIAL waters; NATIONAL security; NATUNA Islands (Indonesia); SOUTH China Sea; SOCIAL media,China; Indonesia; Natuna Islands; Securitization; Security; Social media; South China Sea,"After being a neutral actor for decades in the complex South China Sea (SCS) territorial disputes, Indonesia has seen itself compelled by China's assertiveness to become firmer about protecting its territorial sovereignty around the Natuna Islands (NI). Jakarta is alarmed by China's claims that it has undeniable historical fishing rights in the NI territorial waters because they undermine Indonesia's territorial sovereignty. Our analysis loosely adopts the securitization conceptual framework proposed by the Copenhagen School to reveal that Jakarta swiftly securitized the NI issue between 2014 and 2016. Using a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods, this paper unpacks how the Indonesian printed mainstream media discussed the NI in recent years. By the end of 2016, the Indonesian media portrayed China's claims that it has historical fishing rights in the NI territorial waters as the most urgent national security threat to Indonesia, i.e. the NI issue was securitized. This analysis shows that the Indonesian people accepted Jakarta's security discourse, i.e. Jakarta had successfully securitized China's claims over the NI territorial waters. This paper makes a new contribution to the securitization literature by simultaneously analysing the Indonesian news and social media outlets."

"Industrial Automation in China's ""Workshop of the World"".","Sharif, Naubahar; Huang, Yu",China Journal,University of Chicago Press,AUTOMATION; ROBOTICS; TECHNOLOGICAL innovations -- China; MANUFACTURES; BUSINESS enterprises,,"The Chinese government has announced major plans to provide subsidies to upgrade industry through automated manufacturing and robotization. This article examines how the government in the southern city of Dongguan, a leading center of the country's export industry, has promoted a ""Replacing Humans with Machines"" initiative to improve the prospects for local manufacturers facing toughening business conditions since 2007. We explain the conditions that informed the ""Replacing Humans with Machines"" initiative, reveal findings based on numerous on-site interviews with officials, factory managers, and workers about the effects of automation in Dongguan, and analyze the implications for the labor market. We find that the subsidies awarded by the Dongguan government to support automation in local firms played only a minor role in the firms' automation strategies. Instead, the main drivers of automation were competitive market pressures to reduce the workforce, step up productivity, improve product quality, and deal with occupational health and safety. Workers coping with the effects of automation have suffered variously from deskilling and displacement, although in some cases they were offered upskilling through additional training."
Industrial Policies and the Changing Patterns of Investment in the Chinese Economy.,"Holz, Carsten A.",China Journal,University of Chicago Press,INDUSTRIAL policy; CHINA; ECONOMIC conditions in China; INVESTMENTS; PROFITABILITY; ENTREPRENEURSHIP,,"Investment has always played an important role in the economic development strategies of the People's Republic of China. A major reform of the investment system in 2004 shifted the state's focus from direct investment control to industrial policies designed to promote investment in specific economic sectors. But in reality, the industrial policies' preferences have had little effect. The data suggest that investment patterns in China are largely divorced from the industrial policies, and, if anything, predate them. The significant shifts in investments across sectors and ownership forms that have taken place since the early 2000s appear driven far more by profitability considerations and private entrepreneurship than by government policies. The finding negates foreign concerns that the Chinese state via industrial policies such as ""Made in China 2025"" is creating national state-owned technological leaders."

After a period of rapid growth of inequalities, coupled with improved living conditions for all distribution deciles, inequalities have stabilized in China since the mid-2000s. Globally, China is today in a distributive pattern worse than Western Europe or Japan, but it is more egalitarian than the United States and far from the world inequality frontier defined by Brazil, India, South Africa and the Middle East. In this article, we scrutinize three characteristics of the regime of accumulation in China that mitigate the capital-concentrating tendency: 1. the financialization process with Chinese characteristics, 2. the strategic share of State ownership in the economy, 3. its trajectory over the agrarian question."

What are the effects of their potentially selective exposure? In a survey experiment involving 1,200 Chinese internet users from diverse socio-demographic backgrounds, this study finds that Chinese citizens with higher pro-Western orientations and lower regime evaluations are more inclined to read content that is positive about foreign countries or negative about China. More importantly, reading relatively positive foreign media content about foreign countries can improve rather than worsen the domestic evaluations of citizens who self-select such content. The article argues that this is because reputable Western media outlets' reports are generally more realistic than overly rosy information about foreign socio-economic conditions that popularly circulates in China. Consequently, foreign media may have a corrective function and enhance regime stability in an authoritarian country by making regime critics less critical. The article also introduces a new variant of the patient preference trial design that integrates self-selection and random assignment of treatments in a way that is useful for studying information effects."

This article looks closer at this aspect of the CPPCC, drawing on interviews, internal documents, and publicly available information. The findings highlight the complex relationship between officially defined purpose, top-down control, and local practice of reflection-work. Despite the divergence between expressed and intended goals, in practice, this form of CPPCC-work can both be a way to engage CPPCC-members in solving issues of local governance, as well a channel for, broadly defined, political inclusion at the local level in China."

Accounting for a simultaneity bias between innovation and importing and the possible heterogeneous effects across firms, we found that patenting has increased in response to an influx of Chinese imports, but it has adversely affected the quality of innovation, measured by forward citations received. These effects are only observed for globally engaged firms, not for firms focusing on the domestic market."

Heterogeneous analysis shows that industries with high import intensity, capital intensity or technology intensity suffer more MS declines following input trade liberalisation. Further analysis shows that input trade liberalisation increases the import of intermediate inputs while significantly reduces the proportion of service imports for manufacturing industries. The results are robust to a series of robustness checks."
"Input trade liberalisation, institution and markup: Evidence from China's accession to the WTO.","Mao, Qilin; Xu, Jiayun",World Economy,Wiley-Blackwell,COMMERCE; TARIFF; EVIDENCE; CHINA; WORLD Trade Organization; PRICE markup; INSTITUTIONAL environment,firm markups; input tariff liberalisation; institutional environment,"This paper investigates the effects of input trade liberalisation on firm markups and assesses how institutional environment affects such impacts by using Chinese firm‐level data. To identify the causal effects, we exploit the quasi‐natural experiment of China's WTO accession in 2001 and perform difference‐in‐differences estimation. The results show that input tariff liberalisation leads to a substantial increase in firm markups, and institutional environment significantly strengthens such an impact. We further uncover the underlying mechanisms through which input tariff liberalisation boosts firm markups, and show that both price and cost channels work for the input tariff cut effect on firm markups, of which the latter is much more important. In addition, we also demonstrate that input tariff cut significantly fosters aggregate markup growth, and the reallocation effect is found to be an important channel through which input tariff liberalisation boosts aggregate markup growth."

However, Chinese public administration is facing an ""identity crisis"". Chinese scholars have become used to playing the role of consumers of imported concepts, theories, and methods. The urgent task at this stage is for China to develop its own unique paradigm, including concepts, theories, and methodologies, and to contribute to the progress of the whole discipline. The goal of forming their own theoretical framework is urging our Chinese colleagues to challenge themselves in order to consciously engage in independent theoretical thought. More specifically, they should try to keep abreast of theoretical developments in the West and lay emphasis on cutting-edge research, avoid not seeing the forest for the trees, and practise timely adoption of dominant theories."
Institutional Ambiguity in Primary and Preventive Care: Reforming Village Health Services in 21st Century China.,"Müller, Armin",Journal of Contemporary China,Taylor & Francis Ltd,PUBLIC health; MEDICAL care costs; PRIVATE sector; AMBIGUITY; PRIMARY care; RURAL health services; CHINA,,"Village health stations (VHSs) are core providers of health services in rural China, responsible for almost a quarter of all consultations and outpatient services nationwide. During the reform period, misfit regulatory institutions have negatively influenced the quality of their services, as they require self-employed doctors mainly funded through out-of-pocket payments to provide unprofitable preventive care, and cheap primary care services. This study explores the effects of health reforms on VHSs over the last two decades, arguing that the institutional ambiguity resulting from these misfit institutions negatively affected the outcomes of core health reforms. This is evident in the stronger performance of VHSs where doctors are salaried employees. Recent pricing reforms may also come to improve the performance of the private sector."
Institutional Anticorruption in China: Effectiveness on Bribery Incidence.,"Ni, Xing; Su (Su Su), Xuhong",Public Administration Review,Wiley-Blackwell,CORRUPTION; BRIBERY; DETERRENCE (Administrative law); INSTITUTIONAL theory (Sociology); WHISTLEBLOWING; CITIZEN attitudes,,"This article investigates the effectiveness of anticorruption practices against bribery incidence, highlighting top‐down and bottom‐up approaches. A random survey of local residents is used in conjunction with institutional anticorruption indicators. Findings suggest that the top‐down approach works, but with substantial variation across practices. More intense top‐down anticorruption deters bribery incidence within citizens' dense networks, and more judicial convictions directly suppress citizens' bribery experience and willingness. The bottom‐up and combined approaches yield both deterrence and signaling effects, contingent on institutional parameters. More public whistle‐blowing deters citizens' bribery experience and willingness, yet, when coupled with more intense top‐down anticorruption, it signals severe government corruption and predicts more bribery incidence. On the contrary, more grievance filings predict more bribery incidence via signaling effects, but, when bundled with more intense top‐down anticorruption, they deter citizens' subsequent bribery experience and willingness. The article concludes with a discussion of the research findings and theoretical and practical implications."
Institutional Change and Tuberculosis Control: Continuity and Change in Pre- and Post-1949 Shanghai.,"Core, Rachel",American Journal of Chinese Studies,American Journal of Chinese Studies,SOCIAL change; NONPROFIT organizations; SHANGHAI (China); TUBERCULOSIS prevention; WORK environment,institutional change; public health; Shanghai; tuberculosis; work-unit system,"This article examines continuity and change in tuberculosis (TB) control in China with respect to one organization that played a prominent role in this endeavor, the Shanghai Anti-Tuberculosis Association (SATA). The SATA was founded as a nonprofit organization in Shanghai in 1938 with the goals of the prevention and cure of TB and the promotion of public health. Originally, this organization had trouble meeting these goals due to lack of effective antibiotics and the instability of food and housing under wartime conditions. In the 1950s, the Chinese state socialized workplaces, including both factories and health organizations, such as the SATA. The state began guaranteeing people's fundamental needs through the workplace, including improved nutrition and health care. Drawing upon archival documents, clinic reports, and interviews with former care providers, this article illustrates how the SATA capitalized upon new organizational structures in the 1950s to better achieve its goals. Specifically, SATA clinics took chest X-rays, in both workplaces and neighborhoods, and oversaw the treatment of individuals discovered to have TB. The cost of this treatment, using newly discovered antibiotics, was covered for most patients by their workplaces, while the SATA or its clinics helped to cover fees for individuals who did not have workplaces. These integrated efforts succeeded in drastically decreasing TB mortality throughout the city."
Institutional Change in Authoritarian Regimes: Pension Reform in Russia and China.,"Remington, Thomas F.",Problems of Post-Communism,Taylor & Francis Ltd,PENSION reform; REGIME change; BUREAUCRACY; POLICY sciences; RUSSIA; CHINA; DRIFT,,"Historical institutionalism has demonstrated the value of close analysis of policymaking to explain institutional change. Scholars have distinguished four patterns of institutional change: drift, conversion, layering, and displacement. This paper analyzes pension reform in Russia and China to illustrate institutional change in bureaucratic-authoritarian regimes. While policymaking in both countries takes place almost entirely within the state bureaucracy, in China, state authority is much more decentralized than in Russia. This difference helps to explain the difference in the patterns of policy change that we observe in the two cases: periodic abrupt reversals in Russia vs. incrementalism and layering in China."
Institutional Origins of the US–China Trade War: The Concurrence of America's Limited Legal Leverage and China's Overproduction.,"Kim, Youcheer; Kim, Yongshin",Pacific Focus,Wiley-Blackwell,INTERNATIONAL trade disputes; COMMERCIAL policy; LABOR disputes; CHINA; WORLD Trade Organization; OVERPRODUCTION; WIND power,dispute settlement body (DSB); renewable energy; steelmaking; trade war; WTO,"This paper examines why the United States and China could not accommodate their trade disputes within the framework of the World Trade Organization (WTO), which now escalated into a rhetorical and retaliatory tariff war. The existing literature, which assumes the dominance of US institutional power in the WTO litigation process, has not anticipated the administration's current gambit that has ignited a trade war with China. Specifically, many liberal‐minded pundits and public alike were puzzled by the United States imposing self‐destructive tariff measures against the WTO rules, despite the WTO still remains as an effective tool and resource for America's trade policies. Against such a backdrop, this paper claims that the concurrence of America's limited legal leverage in the WTO and China's domestic industrial structure that induces overproduction substantially explains the puzzle. To support this central claim, the paper conducts a comparative case analysis of US–China disputes in two industrial domains: steelmaking and renewable energy, including solar photovoltaic (PV) power and wind power. Despite contrasting domestic industrial structures and sectoral characteristics, the case study shows a similar pattern present in China's successful legal maneuvers and US strategic failures. Furthermore, the study also reveals the structural causes of overproduction beyond the Chinese central authority's managerial capacity."
Intangible welfare? The new economy and social policy in China.,"Liu, Tao; Wang, Chao",Journal of Asian Public Policy,Taylor & Francis Ltd,,automation; Digitalization; e-commerce; intangibility; state revenues,"This article explores the problems and challenges of the new economy for Chinese social policy. The rapid extension of a digital economy, an economy of artificial intelligence and e-shopping, may alter the configuration and basic functional pattern of social protection in China. Since the labour forces of various sectors are replaceable in the course of automation, traditional taxpayers and contributors to social insurance branches will decline in some highly automated sectors, causing sector-related dismissal and depleting the financial resources for social insurance in China. The phenomena of e-employment and e-commerce escape regulation by national tax and welfare regimes, leading to more employees being excluded from tangible social insurance benefits. Further, state revenues will keep decreasing in an epoch of thriving e-business since the tax evasion of e-employments is widely spread. Essentially, the legitimate basis of state-organized social policy will be shaken by the tide of the new economy. Against such backdrop, this article raises the new concept of 'intangible welfare', characterized by a high degree of fluidity and variability of investments, employment relationships, taxpayers and social insurance contributors. New forms of economy require new types of state regulation."
Integrated Fragmentation and the Role of Leading Small Groups in Chinese Politics.,"Tsai, Wen-Hsuan; Zhou, Wang",China Journal,University of Chicago Press,"POLITICAL science; DECENTRALIZATION in government; CHINA; SMALL groups; XI, Jinping, 1953-",,"How are bureaucrats controlled by their superiors in the Chinese political system? ""Leading small groups"" (领导小组) are among the most important mechanisms for integrating the interests and opinions of various government and Party departments so that superiors can ensure that their policies are implemented. This article analyzes the roles of the three main actors in the leading small groups: group leaders, the heads of the lead departments, and the office directors. We discuss how these individuals operate through formal institutional approaches and informal political channels. Group politics of this kind is moving China's decision-making process toward ""integrated fragmentation."" We conclude that compared with previous Chinese regimes, Xi Jinping is making greater use of leading small groups to promote further reforms and to practice individualized centralization."
Interaction between the G20 agenda and members' national-level policy: A theoretical model for increasing G20 effectiveness.,"He, Alex",South African Journal of International Affairs,Taylor & Francis Ltd,,China; effectiveness; enhanced structural reform agenda; green finance agenda; orchestration-intermediary theory; political coalition; regime theory,"Based on regime theory and orchestration-intermediary theory on the interaction of international institutions, complemented with a revisionist realist perspective, this article proposes a theoretical model to examine the effectiveness of the G20 agenda. The theoretical model consists of weighing up a member state's willingness and capacity to build a political coalition and technical support from relevant intermediary institutions on a G20 agenda, as well as the use of coercion or soft power pressure by the political coalition behind the agenda. Employing a case study approach, the article illustrates the theoretical process by examining (1) the Enhanced Structural Reform Agenda and (2) the green finance agenda at the G20 Hangzhou Summit of 2016. The article concludes that any real progress achieved on the G20 agenda in the post-crisis period requires the presence of all factors in the theoretical model and provides recommendations on improving the G20's effectiveness based on the case studies."
"Inter-American Relations in the Age of Trump: How the U.S. Is Losing Its Grip on Its Volatile ""Backyard"".","BECKMANN, Nicolas Alexander",Perceptions: Journal of International Affairs,Republic of Turkey Ministry of Foreign Affairs Center for Strategic Research,,Cuba; Latin America; U.S. foreign policy; Venezuela; war on drugs,"Since the early 19th century, the U.S. has exerted strong political and economic influence over Latin America. The painful experiences of the Cold War, when the U.S. supported military dictatorships across the region, and assisted anticommunist forces in Central America, left deep scars in Latin America's collective memory. This article claims that while the Obama administration undertook a series of measures to re-establish some trust, Donald Trump's aggressive rhetoric against immigrants from Latin America, his Cuba Policy, and his threat of using military force in Venezuela have reinforced a negative image of the U.S. It also argues that threats of budget cuts for foreign aid and a protectionist trade policy are undermining the U.S. capacity to exert influence on its southern neighbours. This will most likely bring the region closer to China and other extra-regional powers, which have been increasing their profile there in recent years."
Inter-Governmental Vertical Competition in China's Urbanization Process.,"Lu, Warren Wenzhi; Tsai, Kellee S.",Journal of Contemporary China,Taylor & Francis Ltd,URBANIZATION; PROVINCIAL governments; INTERGOVERNMENTAL fiscal relations; GOVERNMENT revenue; CHINESE provinces; ADMINISTRATIVE & political divisions in China,,"Urbanization in China involves administrative conversion of rural counties into urban districts. During the 1990s, provincial governments enhanced the authority of county governments by building more direct linkages between the two levels. Yet prefecture-level cities retained direct administrative authority over counties on certain issues. Based on fieldwork and an original database of administrative reorganization cases from 2011 to 2016, the authors observe that vertical competition between provinces and prefecture-level cities is mediating, and in some cases, thwarting the latter's urbanization efforts. Contrary to the expectation that more developed localities will incorporate wealthier counties, provincial capitals and less developed localities are incorporating counties with the highest fiscal revenue. In developing this argument, this article highlights the neglected role of the provincial government in administrative reorganization and the fiscal implications of urbanization."
International Community's Approach to Western Balkans: In Search of Stability and Security.,"Juvan, Janez",Croatian International Relations Review,Institut za Medunarodne Odnose,COMMUNITIES; INTERNATIONAL cooperation; EUROPEAN cooperation; EUROPEAN Union; WESTERN countries; SCIENTIFIC community,conflict solutions; EU enlargement; international community; Western Balkans,"The article presents research on the international community's engagement in the countries of the Western Balkans in the past and their possible approach in the future. The focus of our research is on the functioning of mechanisms through which the international community performs certain tasks in the region. These interventions are primarily political, in the form of conferences, political programmes, consultations, pressures and continuous persuasion. Economic initiatives follow afterwards. By using different reform approaches, international institutions try to improve cooperation with the European Union (EU) and countries such as the USA, Russia, Turkey and China. Our research attempts to identify possible methods and new solutions for individual cases of conflict in Western Balkans countries, especially where the international community is actively involved. On this basis, we created a more holistic approach. The application of these measures could make the necessary reforms of the future easier. Our approach emphasises all the elements of security that are essential to the stability of the region and for the prevention of conflicts in the future."
International joint ventures and technology diffusion: Evidence from China.,"Liu, Qing; Lu, Ruosi; Yang, Chao",World Economy,Wiley-Blackwell,TECHNOLOGY transfer; EVIDENCE; CHINA; JOINT ventures; EMPLOYEE training,China; FDI; international joint ventures; technology diffusion,"This paper investigates international technology diffusion through FDI by explicitly considering the ownership structure of FDI projects with detailed Chinese data. We find that international joint ventures (JVs) generate significantly positive technology diffusion effects, while wholly foreign‐owned firms (WFOs) generate significantly negative competition effects. The differentiated impacts of JVs and WFOs are robust, heterogeneous and causal as shown by our instrumental variable estimation. As for the mechanisms, evidence suggests that JVs bring better technology to the host country, invest more in R&D and employee training, and also provide easier technology access to local firms than WFOs."

Recent scholarship on historical East Asian orders challenges these notions. The fundamental organizing principle in historical East Asia was hierarchy, not sovereign equality. The region was characterized by hegemony, not balance of power. This emerging research program has direct implications for enduring questions about the relative importance of cultural and material factors in both international orders and their influence on behavior—for describing and explaining patterns of war and peace across time and space, for understanding East Asia as a region made up of more than just China, and for more usefully comparing East Asia, Europe, and other regions of the world."
International relations from the margins: the Westphalian meta-narratives and counter-narratives in Okinawa–Taiwan relations.,"Chen, Ching-Chang; Shimizu, Kosuke",Cambridge Review of International Affairs,Taylor & Francis Ltd,"INTERNATIONAL relations; COLONIZATION; BATTLEFIELDS; MONUMENTS; CHINESE-Japanese War, 1894-1895; CHINA",,"This article examines competing narratives over belonging and authority at Japan's and China's margins by excavating the discursive practices employed by relevant state and substate actors in framing, contesting and (dis)assembling totalizing claims over Ryukyu/Okinawa and Taiwan since the late nineteenth century. Informed by the critical international relations literature on practices of statecraft and Foucauldian conceptions of power as productive and discursive, we suggest that the aforementioned 'margins' are sites central to the constitution, production and maintenance of Chinese and Japanese state identities, which have been repeatedly performed through violent material and discursive practices concealing these two states' lack of ontological foundation. We look at how the state-centric narratives employed by the Chinese and Japanese authorities have worked to limit, curtail and suppress their locally generated counter-narratives in such cases as the Taiwan Expedition (1874), the Diaoyutai/Senkaku Islands dispute and boundary-making between Okinawa and Taiwan. However, these cases also show that efforts to contain resistance to the state's inscription of boundaries separating an 'inside/self/domestic' from an 'outside/other/foreign' cannot fully succeed, not only because where there is power there is resistance but also because the state would wither away should its identity formation be successful in the terms in which it is articulated."

However, the globalisation process embraces heterogeneities and contradictions stemming from the integration of different states into a single global structure. This article explores the role and motivations of domestic social classes in creating variations in the form of integration of their states into the global whole. It takes one of the odd cases at the centre of inquiry and particularly concentrates on the emergence of alternative forms to the neoliberal globalisation in the process of Iran's integration into the global capitalism. The accumulation strategies adopted by the dominant class factions in Iran are investigated in order to reveal their dialectical relationship with the international capitalist structure. Their role in the international political economy of Iran demonstrates how social agents through their strategic activities create variations in the forms of integration into the global capitalism. The article compares the Iranian case to the varieties of integration of lately capitalised but not peripherised BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) states. This aims to reveal that whilst these countries have truly integrated into the global capitalist system, the internationalisation of their states contradicts the accumulation strategies of their dominant classes."
Intervention with Chinese characteristics: the Belt and Road Initiative reconfiguring (Afro-)Eurasian geo-economics.,"Forough, Mohammadbagher","Conflict, Security & Development",Taylor & Francis Ltd,INTERNATIONAL economic relations; HUMAN geography; EURASIANS,Belt and Road Initiative (BRI); China–Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC); Geo-economics; intervention,"With the increasing influence of China, the future of its non-interference policy is being increasingly debated both in China and abroad. This contribution investigates the question of intervention with Chinese characteristics by focusing on the 'geo' in the geo-economics of the Chinese Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), which is spatially reterritorialising the social geography of (Afro-)Eurasia. This reconfiguration challenges intervention research. By analysing the China–Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) as an illustration, this article argues that the geo-economic social geography of BRI is supplanting the current geopolitical social geography (dominated by the USA). Through geo-economic interventions, Chinese infrastructure projects create new geo-economic connectivity through corridors in various territories, which have been rendered simply geo-politicised (Pakistan or Iran) or insignificant (Africa) in the global economy. The article concludes by discussing some implications of geo-economic interventions for intervention research."

However, XUAR's location on the Silk Road Economic Belt (SREB) has increased the importance of this frontier region and it is now an important element in the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and China's future. Moreover, given the BRI now underpins Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era and Xi Jinping Thought on Diplomacy, XUAR has increasingly become interwoven into the China Dream, the BRI and Xi's legacy, resulting in serious human rights violations there. This article argues that the repressive control of XUAR demonstrates Beijing's acute anxiety over opening this region up to external influences, particularly from Central Asian and Middle Eastern SREB states."

Political theology in China raises many questions that western readers will find familiar, but the Chinese context often requires different answers, so that gaining familiarity with the Chinese discussion can broaden our view of the available options at the intersection of religion and politics. At the same time, seeing familiar questions from a Chinese perspective can illuminate implicit disagreements within the western context that would otherwise remain hidden. This special issue brings together theologians, ethicists, sociologists, and legal scholars around fundamental questions of political order in a rapidly changing society."

However, research has thus far mostly focused on BRI's reception in Central Asia and (Eastern) Europe. In this introduction, we first provide an overview of the literature by identifying three main strands of interpretation on BRI, namely those focusing on geoeconomics, on geopolitics, and on international norms as well as order. Next, we provide a review of the contemporary research on both Southeast Asian and Northeast Asian perceptions of and policy responses to BRI. Finally, we discuss research gaps in the literature and provide an overview of case studies and findings in this special issue. We conclude by identifying recurring themes and characteristics in East Asian responses to BRI."

Introduction: Can America and China Escape the Thucydides Trap?,"Zhang, Chunman; Pu, Xiaoyu",Journal of Chinese Political Science,Springer Nature,POWER (Social sciences); CONFLICT management; CHINA-United States relations,Power; Sino-U.S. relations; Thucydides trap; Uncertainty,"Can China rise peacefully? Will China and the United States go to war? As U.S. and China face rising tensions in trade, technology, cyberspace, and the South China Sea, etc., scholars are concerned about the future of the Sino-U.S. relationship. In history, the relationship between a rising power and a hegemonic power often ends up with severe conflicts, even wars. The main reason is probably the Thucydides Trap, which Graham Allison defines as the severe structural stress caused when a rising power threatens to upend a ruling one. This special issue invite scholars from China, U.S. and other countries to examine the theoretical mechanisms and policy implications of the Thucydides Trap. Each of these articles in this special issue examines unique problems and makes original contributions to our understanding of the Thucydides Trap and U.S.-China relationship. Most authors in this special issue believe that the Thucydides Trap provides a useful lens for studying the China-U.S. relationship in spite of some reservations. This special issue addresses two broad questions: First, how can one construct a thick and comprehensive understanding of the Thucydides Trap? Second, how to analyze, examine and even predict the tensions, problems and future of the Sino-U.S. relationship? There is no doubt that the current relationship between the two has deteriorated to an extent that old paradigms of conflict resolutions seem to be obsolete. Although it's difficult to predict the future of Sino-U.S. relations, both countries especially political leaders can search for new paradigms to escape the Thucydides Trap. America and China are not destined for war, but destined for an uncertain future."
Introduction: Dimensions of Sino–Japanese rivalry in a global context.,"Schulze, Kai; Blechinger-Talcott, Verena",Pacific Review,Taylor & Francis Ltd,INTERNATIONAL relations; JAPANESE economic assistance,China; Japan; rivalry,"This special issue analyzes the evolving notion of Sino–Japanese rivalry and its effects on concrete foreign policy measures of both states in a global context. China's emergence as a great power and Japan's attempts to 'normalize' its foreign relations took place alongside both countries increasing their political engagement in world regions beyond Northeast Asia. As a result, there has been increasing mutual monitoring of and increasing concern expressed about the intentions and actions of the respective other on these different levels of world politics. This has largely been neglected in the literature. This special issue closes the gap in the literature by providing answers to the following questions: Is there a Sino–Japanese rivalry in the first place? Which factors define this rivalry? Are there different levels and/or kinds of rivalry? Which factors influence Sino–Japanese rivalry in different regions and on different levels of the international system? Do these factors differ across regional and institutional boundaries? Answering these questions requires us to conceptualize what is meant by rivalry as well as to focus on Sino–Japanese interaction in different world regions and on the level of international institution building. This special issue also contributes to the literature on interstate rivalry by challenging common understandings of the concept of rivalry and by adding new facets and interpretation of rivalry based on the concrete empirical cases. It will therefore provide a broadened perspective on the characteristics of Sino–Japanese relations, the mutual impacts of Japan's and China's globalizing foreign policies, and on our understanding of the determinants and mechanisms of interstate rivalries."
Introduction: Revisiting the security dilemma through the lens of India-China relations.,"Basrur, Rajesh; Mukherjee, Anit; Paul, T. V.",Asian Security,Taylor & Francis Ltd,NATIONAL security; INTERNATIONAL relations; CHINA-India relations; ASIA,,"This introduction explains the rationale for this special issue of Asian Security. It begins with a short discussion about the relevance and the utility of the term ""security dilemma"" in international relations. The concept, which emerged during the Cold War, has since been used extensively to describe India-China relations. This special issue attempts to add to our understanding of the India-China relationship as well as to contribute to enriching the theoretical literature in a number of ways. First, it represents the first detailed effort to present a set of analyses that encompasses theory, history, and the full spectrum of strategic issue areas to explain the dynamics of a key contemporary inter-state relationship involving China and India. Second, the analysis reveals the complexity of security dilemma politics by highlighting how states respond to their predicament in different ways. Third, this special issue draws attention to an area that has been largely neglected in the literature: the relationship between the security dilemma as a concept and domestic politics. Finally, a case can be made that a security dilemma-type response in a situation that does not demand it may actually create a dilemma where none existed before. These and other complexities are abundant in this collection of articles. The chapter concludes by summarizing the main arguments presented by the contributors to this special issue."

What eﬀects will the realization of the BRI have on the geo economical and geopolitical status of Iran? On the one hand, this project can boost China's presence and inﬂuence in the political economy of Iran and its neighborhood, and create new domains of competition between Iran and China. On the other hand, it could contribute to the revival of Iran's historical role in the ancient Silk Road. Thus, to participate in this project, Iran is stuck between hope and fear. It is fearful for Iran because it has negative eﬀects on Iranian interests, at the same time Iran is hopeful because it can enhance its economic development and raise its historical role as a bridge between the East and the West. As a result, Iran tries at the same time to develop its relationships with the EU as well as cooperation with China in the framework of the BRI. Iran tries to maximize its interests from the project and reduce its negative eﬀects on its geo economic and geopolitical interests.

The PRC got involved in such projects initially in 1979, and this intensified in 1990s. The history of such projects reveals how regional and non-regional actors have promoted a variety of visions for the configuration of Europe-Asia overland freight transport corridors in two historical periods: the years of the Cold War, and the years of the post-Cold War. I argue that, here, such projects aimed at connecting countries and continents while also excluding others, and to show how various global actors have historically seen—and still do so today—the establishment of such corridors through a technocratic lens, namely not only to promote intercultural exchanges, but to consolidate political and economic alliances across countries and continents by bridging the peoples of different nation-states but also civilisations."
Is a New Cold War Inevitable? Chinese Perspectives on US–China Strategic Competition.,"Zhao, Minghao",Chinese Journal of International Politics,Oxford University Press / USA,COLD War & politics; ECONOMIC competition; POLITICAL leadership; POWER (Social sciences); CHINA-United States relations,,"In recent years, Chinese scholars and policy elites have discussed the ever intensifying strategic competition between the United States and China and its multifaceted implications for Chinese foreign policy. Some even worry about the possibility of a new Cold War between the United States and China. This article aims to offer an analysis of Chinese perspectives on US–China strategic competition. In the view of most Chinese observers, US–China strategic competition is inevitable because China is closing the national power gap between itself and the United States, while the latter resolutely upholds its global primacy. Other factors, including ideological disagreements, may fuel the major power competition that has extended to most aspects of US–China relations. Chinese observers believe that economic and technological rivalry between the United States and China has heightened and that the Western Pacific is the focal point of US–China strategic competition. Meanwhile, certain Chinese scholars attach greater importance to US–China competition over international prestige and leadership. However, Chinese analysts are not overly pessimistic about the prospects for US–China relations and have raised policy recommendations geared to managing US–China strategic competition and restoring a new equilibrium between the two major powers."
IS A TRADE DEAL IMMINENT?,"GLASER, BONNIE S.; FLAHERTY, KELLY",Comparative Connections: A Triannual E-Journal on East Asian Bilateral Relations,Center for Strategic & International Studies,"MONEY laundering; OBSTRUCTION of justice; TRUMP, Donald, 1946-",,"Intense trade talks in the first four months of 2019 made progress, raising hopes that a deal will be reached in May, and signed by Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping soon thereafter. Remaining sticking points include the enforcement mechanism, which is a key US demand, and a schedule for lifting the tariffs, which is a Chinese priority. The US Department of Justice unsealed an indictment charging Huawei and its CFO Meng Wanzhou with financial fraud, money laundering, obstruction of justice, sanctions violations, and other crimes. Tensions increased over Taiwan as the Trump administration took steps to strengthen ties with Taipei and warn Beijing to back off its coercive and destabilizing policies. President Trump welcomed China's decision to add fentanyl-related substances to a supplementary list of controlled drugs and substances beginning May 1. Growing US concerns about Chinese espionage were highlighted publicly in speeches by senior Trump administration officials."
Is Australia's Indo-Pacific strategy an illusion?,"Taylor, Brendan",International Affairs,Oxford University Press / USA,MIDDLE powers; INTERNATIONAL relations; BOUNDARY disputes; INDO-Pacific Region; SOUTH China Sea; AUSTRALIA -- Foreign relations,East Asia; foreign policy; international security; regional security,"Australia has been among the most prominent advocates of the increasingly popular Indo-Pacific concept. This article argues that Canberra's enthusiasm for the concept stems from its appeal to the two dominant traditions of Australian foreign policy—a 'dependent ally' tradition and a 'middle power' approach. While these two traditions are typically seen as being in tension, the Indo-Pacific concept provides a rare point of convergence between them. The article begins by outlining the appeal of the Indo-Pacific concept to each of these traditions. Using a case-study of recent Australian policy toward the South China Sea disputes, however, the article then demonstrates that Australia has in practice implemented its stated Indo-Pacific strategy far less consistently than its very vocal support would appear to suggest. This disjuncture is attributed to the growing influence of a third, generally understudied, 'pragmatic' Australian foreign policy tradition. Because Australia has been such a prominent champion of the Indo-Pacific concept, the article concludes that this divergence between the rhetoric and the reality of Australia's Indo-Pacific strategy threatens to have a negative impact on the concept's broader international appeal and sustainability, particularly among Australia's south-east Asian neighbours."

Using a mixed method that combined in-depth interviews, Afrobarometer, and Johns Hopkins' China Africa Research Initiative (CARI) data, I find that, despite a few gains, China takes the lion's share of benefits from the cooperation. Indeed, the balance of trade is skewed toward China, and there is very little Chinese foreign direct investment (FDI) flowing to Africa. Moreover, 'debt trap diplomacy' is crippling African economies, raising alarm over whether China intends to recolonize the continent. Also, while Chinese aid is negligible, the amount of contracts revenues and diplomatic support it gets from the continent makes one think Africa deserves more from the cooperation. Nevertheless, China, just like any other country, acts in its nation's interest. Therefore, it is incumbent upon African countries to ensure that they demand more from the cooperation. In the end, to address China's hegemony over Sino-African cooperation, Africa should prioritize the development of local content through technological and skill transfers, curb corruption, and build a critical mass of negotiators."
Is China's rise now stalling?,"Lynch, Daniel C.",Pacific Review,Taylor & Francis Ltd,PROBABILITY theory; UNITED States; CHINA; CHINESE Communist Party; FRAMES (Social sciences),China; economy; middle-income trap; population; power transition; rise,"The variations on power transition theory so widely used to frame analysis of U.S.–China relation tend to assume the inevitability or at least strong probability of China surpassing the United States in economic power if not necessarily military power. In the terminology of social psychology's attribution theory, China is imputed with the identity of a state that is inevitably rising. The Chinese Communist Party encourages this attribution among Chinese people and foreigners. But China's economic rise – the foundation of its comprehensive rise – appears to have entered an inflection point in the mid-2010s and may now be stalling. In critical respects, China increasingly resembles the last two countries that 'attempted' a globe-level rise: the unsuccessful cases of postwar Japan and the Soviet Union. China's labor force is shrinking; the country relies excessively on unsustainable debt increases to fuel economic growth; and pollution is seriously harming public health. But even if China's rise conclusively stalls, it may take quite some time before the Chinese public and outside observers recognize the new reality because of intrinsic biases in the cognitive logic of attributing identities to actors."
Is fiscal revenue concentration ratio in China too high?,"Fang, Hongsheng; Shuai, Wenjun; Yu, Linhui; Zhang, Jun",World Economy,Wiley-Blackwell,FEDERAL government; CHINA; DEVELOPING countries,asymmetric degree of China's central fiscal revenue concentration ratio and expenditure concentration ratio; budgetary concentration ratio; full‐calibre concentration ratio; international comparison,"This paper challenges the viewpoint that fiscal revenue concentration ratio in China is too high. First, this paper estimates China's nominal and real fiscal revenue concentration ratios at both budgetary and full‐calibre levels, and makes an international comparison using all available data of the IMF's GFS database for both developed and developing countries, revealing five stylised facts that expresses serious doubts about the statement that fiscal revenue concentration ratio in China is too high. Second, the paper proposes four indicators to measure asymmetric degree of China's central fiscal revenue concentration ratio and expenditure concentration ratio to identify whether fiscal revenue concentration ratio in China is too high. The results show that: (i) central fiscal revenue concentration ratio is lower and (ii) compared with asymmetric degree of China's central budgetary fiscal revenue concentration ratio and expenditure concentration ratio, asymmetric degree of China's central full‐calibre fiscal revenue concentration ratio and expenditure concentration ratio is more serious, indicating that the central full‐calibre revenue concentration ratio is much lower. Therefore, this paper not only disproves the view that China's fiscal revenue concentration ratio is too high, but also shows that China's fiscal revenue concentration ratio, especially at a full‐calibre level, is much lower. Further international comparison shows that asymmetric degree of China's central fiscal revenue concentration ratio and expenditure concentration ratio is ranked third in the world, and Chinese central government has the lowest ability to undertake full‐calibre fiscal expenditure among the world's countries. Finally, following the State Council's guidance on properly increasing central authority, the paper argues that it is necessary for the central government to improve central fiscal revenue concentration ratio, especially at the full‐calibre level."
Is India a New Emerging Great Power?,"Pröbsting, Michael",Critique: Journal of Socialist Theory,Taylor & Francis Ltd,GREAT powers (International relations); WORLD politics; RACISM,BRICS; Developing Countries; Great Powers; Hindutva; Marxism; Racism; South Asia; Super-Exploitation,"A key issue discussed by observers in world politics is the question if India is becoming a new Great Power. Already six years ago, the British magazine 'The Economist' asked 'Can India become a great power?' (30.06.2013). Stratfor- an influential right-wing US geopolitical intelligence company—published an essay last year which deals with the same question ('India Struggles With Its Strategy for Becoming a Great Power', 23.03.2018). And China's Global Times—the international edition of regime's central organ People's Daily—also discusses 'India's great power status' (Liu Zongyi: China-India bid can forge united Asia, Global Times, 08.10.2019). There exists even an entry on Wikipedia called 'India as an emerging superpower'. This question is currently particularly relevant since India has become an important factor in world politics in the recent past—as the catastrophic developments in Kashmir, the tensions at the border with Pakistan and the developments around the US-initiated 'Indo-Pacific alliance' as well as the China-led RCEP free trade agreement demonstrate. In this essay, we intend to show that India—despite the clear ambitions of its ruling class—has not become an imperialist Great Power and is highly unlikely to become such in the foreseeable future. While it certainly plays an increasing role as a kind of regional or intermediate power, it basically remains a semi-colonial country which does not dominate global economic and political relations. The analysis outlined in this essay is based on several studies on Indian capitalism which the author has published in the last years (See e.g. 'The Kashmir Question and the Indian Left Today', 26.09.2019, ; India: A Prison House of Nations and Lower Castes, 16.08.2019, ; The China-India Conflict: Its Causes and Consequences, August 2017, )."
Is International Leadership Changing Hands or Disappearing?

Less attention, however, has been given to the possibility of a US withdrawal from its role at the center of the order it helped to create. Since the election of Donald Trump, however, the prospect of a ""leadership vacuum,"" caused by American policies that seek to dismantle, weaken, or ignore various international institutions, has become an increasingly important issue. In this article we explore the historical nature of US hegemony and the factors that may be encouraging the Trump administration to abandon America's leadership role. We also consider the factors that may inhibit China from offering an alternative. Consequently, we argue that international order in the near future may be defined by a lack of leadership rather than a hegemonic transition."
Is Strict Reciprocity Required for Fair Trade?,"Chow, Daniel C. K.; Sheldon, Ian",Vanderbilt Journal of Transnational Law,Vanderbilt Journal of Transnational Law,"RECIPROCITY (Commerce); INTERNATIONAL trade; TARIFF; BALANCE of trade; RESTRAINT of trade; UNITED States; TRUMP, Donald, 1946-",,"The administration of Donald J. Trump has repeatedly claimed that reciprocity is required for ""fair"" trade. While this concept is not new in US political discourse, the Trump administration's insistence that strict or absolute reciprocity is required goes beyond any claims made by previous US administrations. By strict reciprocity, the United States means that all trade volumes and terms and conditions of trade must be mirror images of each other. As the United States has a trade deficit with all of its largest trading partners, the Trump administration claims that this is evidence of unfairness in trade harming the United States. Since countries like China have tariff rates (25 percent) for a particular import, such as automobiles, that are significantly higher than US tariff rates (2.5 percent) for imported automobiles, this is also evidence of unfair trade that adds to the US trade deficit. Based on this lack of strict reciprocity, the United States claims that trade with many of its partners is unfair and has imposed punitive trade sanctions to correct the imbalance. This Article demonstrates that not only is strict reciprocity impossible to achieve in practice, but it is based on a critical misunderstanding of elementary economic concepts. Since the Trump administration has not proven its case that the lack of strict reciprocity is evidence of unfair trade, the United States must either find an alternative justification or withdraw the sanctions."
Is the AIIB a China‐controlled Bank? China's Evolving Multilateralism in Three Dimensions (3D).,"Zhu, Jiejin",Global Policy,Wiley-Blackwell,DEVELOPMENT banks; INTERNATIONAL cooperation; CHINA; ASIAN Infrastructure Investment Bank; INVESTMENT banking; BANKING industry,,"Is the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank a China‐controlled bank? This basic question highlights the issue of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank's (AIIB) international credibility, especially as a multilateral institution. AIIB president Jin Liqun recognized the 'multilateral challenge' for China from the outset of the planning to create the new Bank, and he understood that the new Bank would only be a real success for China if the AIIB is truly a multilateral development bank – inside Beijing circles, he added, 'and only if the new Bank does better than the long‐established counterpart MDBs'. These sentiments were alluded to in Jin's remarks in the Financial Times: 'China benefited a lot from the existing international system. China needs to do something which can help it be recognized as a responsible member and maybe a responsible leader in the future... if it does well, that will enhance China's credibility, but if this institution does not follow the international best practice, who will believe in China in the future'. Skeptics, however, question whether it is ever possible that China will allow the AIIB to develop into an actual multilateral bank. Compared with other China‐backed international initiatives, such as the BRI, the AIIB has developed or gained a fairly high level of international credibility, as a multilateral organization, and sooner than many observers predicted."

Moscow and Beijing have endorsed Pyongyang's negotiating posture and much evidence suggests a Russo--Chinese alliance, albeit an informal one. Such an alliance possesses immense implications for the ongoing efforts to find a negotiated path out of the Korean nuclearization crisis and for regional security in general. But in the meantime the advent of such an alliance imparts a quality of regional bipolarity to the Northeast Asian security agenda that could obstruct further progress towards peace."
Is There a New International Trade Order? 1.,"Researcher, Zhao Yujia Assistant",Chinese Journal of International Politics,Oxford University Press / USA,"INTERNATIONAL trade; UNITED States; WORLD Trade Organization; GLOBAL Financial Crisis, 2008-2009; TRUMP, Donald, 1946-",,"The rapid rise of China and other emerging economies has led many to believe that the world order is in transition. The relative strength of the major trading countries (the international trade configuration) in the international trade arena has changed significantly; the growth of international trade, meanwhile, has slowed down since the global financial crisis in 2008–2009. Some observers claim that there is disorder, or at least a new type of normative order emerging in international trade. This anxiety peaked when President Donald Trump took office and adopted a set of protectionist and unilateral trade policies detrimental to US trade partners. This article develops an analytical framework to measure international trade in 1996–2017 in order to explore whether or not the international trade order still exists or, as many claim, it has changed. The results suggest that international trade in 2017 remains in order, and that the normative type of this order has not changed compared to that in 1996, when the World Trade Organization was freshly established. This suggests, therefore, that changes in the international trade configuration do not necessarily lead to changes in the international trade order. Although the Trump administration's trade policies challenge the stability of this normative order, the influence of the United States on such order is largely limited by the diverged rule-making power in multilateral frameworks. More importantly, the United States seems interested in revising detailed trading rules to suit American interests, rather than in challenging current trading principles. Therefore, this article argues that the current international order will not be eliminated, and that a normative order of this type is unlikely to be replaced by another one."
Is there a U.S.–China–India triangle? – Beijing's official views.,"Korolev, Alexander; Wu, Fengshi",India Review,Taylor & Francis Ltd,INTERNATIONAL cooperation; MILITARY science; NATIONAL interest; CHINA-India relations; CHINA-United States relations; INDIA-United States relations,,"This research examines China's official perspectives on, and interpretation of, U.S.-China-India relations by surveying official, quasi-official, and some most relevant scholarly publications. China's official line has always emphasized the bilateral nature of the relationship between China and India fending off any third-party interference, including that from the United States. Neither Chinese leaders nor the regime's official media outlets would speak of China–India relationship with a triangular framework (with a rare exception of the Russia–India–China triangle). In the context of the rapid evolvement of U.S.-India military cooperation, the Chinese official line remains unforthcoming about whether such developments have direct implication for China's security or national interests. Chinese core official media has in fact minimized the popularization of the idea that containing China is the driving force behind any cooperation between India and the United States."
"Isolated counties, administrative monitoring, and the misuse of public funds in China.","Li, Li; Pang, Baoqing; Wu, Yiping",Governance,Wiley-Blackwell,TRANSFER payments; LOCAL government; COUNTIES; REPRESENTATIVE government; CHINA; FINANCE,,"This article empirically investigates the effects of administrative monitoring on the misuse of funds by local governments and provides a representative model of fiscal decentralization with political centralization, where administrative monitoring relies on the top‐down hierarchy of the bureaucratic system in China based on a unique data set from audit programs. We show a double effect between distance and monitoring in local China. The incentive for misusing public funds can be strengthened if the county (a) is governed by a leader whose tenure is longer than 3 years, (b) is governed by a politician from outside the county, or (c) receives more transfer payments. These findings suggest that the administrative monitoring of local governments can be vital to remedying the misuse of public funds."

"""It Is Good to Have Something Different"": Mutual Fashion Adaptation in the Context of Chinese Migration to Mozambique.","von Pezold, Johanna",Asia Pacific Perspectives,Center for Asia-Pacific Studies,IMMIGRANTS; MOZAMBIQUE; FASHION,adaptation; China; China-Africa relations; fashion; globalization; Mozambique; soft power,"Based on ethnographic field research in the Mozambican capital Maputo, this article explains why and how contemporary Chinese migrants and Mozambicans adopt elements of each other's fashion. Due to their variety and good quality-price ratio, Chinese fashion products are increasingly well-received by Mozambicans. In search of novel additions to their own style, both Chinese and Mozambicans become attracted by the exotic appeal of what they consider ""typical"" of the other culture. Unlike the situation in many colonial and post-colonial contexts, Chinese-Mozambican fashion adaptation is motivated by the desire to achieve a novel, distinct, and fashionable individual look, rather than by the wish to express progressivity or employability. This study demonstrates that the adaptation of fashion elements in the Chinese-Mozambican context has specific characteristics that distinguish it from fashion exchanges between Western and non-Western countries. Moreover, it shows that China indeed has ""low"" cultural soft power in the form of fashion."

I posit that autocratic leaders may choose greater exposure to an external threat if, by doing so, it preserves regime legitimacy. Specifically, the desire to promote a positive image to one's domestic public creates incentives to publicly downplay a rival's military progress, which then affects the state's ability to mobilize resources to respond to the growing threat. I test this theory in the case of China's response to India's military rise. This research contributes to balancing theory and empirical work on East Asian security."
Japan and TPP/TPP-11: opening black box of domestic political alignment for proactive economic diplomacy in face of 'Trump Shock'.,"Terada, Takashi",Pacific Review,Taylor & Francis Ltd,POLITICAL realism; ECONOMIC expansion; LEADERSHIP; ECONOMIC policy; TRANS-Pacific Partnership; JAPAN,Abe; Kantei; neoclassical realism; RCEP; TPP/TPP-11; Trump,"Based on the neoclassical realism approach, this article aims to clarify factors conducive to Japan's different roles in both participating in the trans-pacific partnership (TPP) and concluding the TPP-11 by focusing on how the US's distinctive attitudes towards the TPP under the Obama and Trump administrations influenced Japan's changing approaches. During the Obama administration, which needed Japan's participation to expand the TPP in the face of China's growing global and regional economic influence, Japan incorporated the TPP into its growth strategy and committed itself to sustaining US leadership during TPP negotiations by making necessary concessions on both the international and domestic fronts. By contrast, the Trump administration, with its strong propensity for bilateral deals to counter China's bid for global economic hegemony with the TPP withdrawal urged Japan to change its reactive stance and take a proactive role in TPP-11 negotiations. This article opens a 'black box' of the political system under the second administration of Shinzo Abe, and demonstrates the strengthened function of the Prime Minister's Office and Cabinet Secretariat or Kantei within the centralised trade policy-making apparatus as key mechanisms contributing to a departure from the traditional features that occasionally hampered Japan's foreign economic policy initiatives."

This study uses nationally representative longitudinal data from Japan to investigate how the economic and political threats are relevant to Japanese attitudes toward China and the United States. Empirical analyses find that: first, socioeconomic status (SES) is significantly associated with individuals' attitudes toward the United States but not China. Second, individuals' perceptions of Japan's economic situation influence their attitudes toward China and the United States; that is, an optimistic assessment of Japan's economy increases the Japanese people's positive attitudes toward both China and the United States. Finally, the political threats have contrasting effects on Japanese attitudes toward China and the United States. Concerns over political threats increase Japan's favorable attitudes toward the United States while deteriorating the positive attitudes toward China."

Tactical hedging refers to a declaratory policy doctrine that aims to utilize temporal strategic ambiguity to understand and determine whether any long-term strategy shift is necessary or possible. In doing so, Japan has bided its time in order to understand strategic trends and coordinate policies and principles with allies and partners—especially the United States and ASEAN—and shaped the concept of a ""Free and Open Indo-Pacific"" (FOIP) in accordance with those consultations since 2016. Nevertheless, the emerging trend—especially the clear division between America's more hardline stance towards China and ASEAN's own conceptualization of the Indo-Pacific which aims to facilitate cooperation with China—indicates that the benefits of tactical hedging are diminishing, and that Japan needs to clarify its political stance if it wants to maintain its own FOIP concept as a viable strategic vision."

The concept initially aimed to achieve two different objectives—shaping a regional order in the Indo-Pacific and ensuring the defence of Japan; however, Japan has gradually shifted its strategic focus onto the former, separating national defence from the FOIP concept, which reflects a change in the degree of its commitment to the two objectives. On the one hand, as its overall security strategy, Japan has determined to steadily enhance its national defence by increasing its own defence capabilities and strengthening the US–Japan alliance, while transforming its partnerships with like-minded states, such as Australia and India, into a diplomatic, and potentially military, alignment. This has been brought about by shifts in the regional balance of power, particularly the rise of China and the relative decline of the United States. On the other hand, as part of its FOIP strategy, Japan's attempts to build a new regional order in the Indo-Pacific region aim to defend the existing rules-based order established by the United States from challengers, particularly China. Yet, given the strategic uncertainty over Japan's international coalition-building efforts to create a new regional order, Japan has made its approach flexible; Tokyo is using its ambiguous FOIP concept to gauge other states' responses, understand their perspectives, and change its strategic emphases accordingly—so-called 'tactical hedging'. Japan has pursued similar means to achieve the two key objectives. Nevertheless, the country's core interest, the defence of Japan, is more imperative than building a regional order in the Indo-Pacific region, and Japan faces different types of challenges in the future."

The Japanese government has thrown off any reticence about self-promotion by more forcefully positioning Japan as a sensitive and sustainable strategic partner for Southeast Asian nations in a strategic contrast with the People's Republic of China (PRC). Rather than trying to contain China, Tokyo is seeking to mediate how China turns its material resources into influence. Despite an increasing asymmetry in material resources between China and Japan, this article argues that Japan maintains a surprising ability to influence the preferences of Southeast Asian nations and responses to exercises of PRC power, which in turn has allowed Japan to influence China's regional strategy."

The article argues that despite very different approaches to public diplomacy during the crisis, both states were primarily concerned with avoiding escalation and ending the confrontation.

Temporary sites and precarious forms of low-wage production serve as fragmented and provisional resources of sociality and labour as migrant workers and urban villages gradually become incorporated within the urban fabric. The unrequited longings of migrant women who work in factories and as caretakers demonstrate how marginal hubs are created through disjunctures of emplacement and mobility, which are intensified as these women attempt to bridge the contradictions entailed in care work and industrial labour across the supply chains."

Both economic and strategic incentives lie behind China's development of these schemes. China's economic incentives include its domestic demand for energy, ""21st Century Maritime Silk Road"" construction, Hainan the pilot free trade zone construction, construction of a common market and the future economic integration among the SCS coastal States. China's strategic incentives include achieving its goal of becoming a leading maritime power, playing its constructive role in maintaining a peaceful and stable SCS, developing good relations with other coastal States, and reducing the intensity of China-U.S. competition in the SCS. China's policy choices on the SCS joint development are as follows: first, to promote good faith in the SCS; second, to limit unilateral activities in disputed areas; third, to focus on less sensitive areas of the SCS; fourth, to reach joint development arrangements by establishing relevant working mechanism; fifth, to begin the process in areas where there are only two claimants; sixth, to define sea areas for the joint development by seeking consensus; seventh, to discuss the feasibility of setting up a Spratly Resource Management Authority (SRMA) with supranational character."

Journey to the East: A Philosophical Inquiry into the Early Reception of St. Augustine in China.,"Gao, Yuan",International Journal of Asian Studies,Cambridge University Press,,Augustine; China; philosophical inquiry; religious values,"In modern scholarship, much ink has been spilled over the significance of St. Augustine in the history of Western philosophy and theology. However, little effort has been made to clarify the legacy of Augustine in East Asia, especially his contribution to China during the early Jesuit missionary work through the Maritime Silk Road. The present article attempts to fill this lacuna and provide a philosophical analysis of the encounter of Chinese indigenous religions with St Augustine, by inquiring into why and how Augustine was taken as a model for the Chinese in their acceptance of the Christian faith. The analysis is split into three parts. The first part reflects on the contemporary disputations over the quality of the paraphrasing work of the early Jesuits, analyzing the validity of the allegedly careless inaccuracies in their introduction of Augustine's biography. The second part analyses some rarely discussed Chinese translations of Augustine, which I recently found in the Nanjing Union Theological Seminary, with particular focus on their ideological context. In particular, the paraphrased text concerning Augustine's theory of sin and the two cities will be highlighted. The third part goes a step further in exploring the reason why Augustine was considered an additional advantage in dealing with the conflicts between Christian and Confucian values. The primary contribution this essay makes is to present a philosophical inquiry into the role of Augustine in the early acceptance of Christianity in China by suggesting that a strategy of ""Confucian-Christian synthesis"" had been adopted by the Jesuit missionaries. Thereby, they accommodated Confucian terms without dropping the core values of the orthodox Catholic faith. The conclusion revisits the critics' arguments and sums up with an evaluation of the impact of Augustine's religious values in the indigenization of Christianity in China."

Judicialization in authoritarian regimes: The expansion of powers of the Chinese Supreme People's Court.,"Ahl, Björn",International Journal of Constitutional Law,Oxford University Press / USA,COURTS; LAW reform; POLITICAL science; CHINA; INDUSTRIAL efficiency,,"Over the past two decades courts in China have undergone tremendous changes as they developed into more professional and efficient institutions for solving legal disputes. Whereas the literature has described the empowerment of Chinese courts as ""intrinsically local,"" we turn to the national level and explore how the development of the Supreme People's Court (SPC) relates to the global phenomenon of a ""judicialization of authoritarian politics."" Drawing on legal documents and secondary literature, the study argues that the SPC has extended its powers gradually and in a non-confrontational manner into the realms of other constitutional actors. The court has expanded its competences primarily through its legislative function and its substantial input into procedural law reforms. As the court serves core interests of the party, the empowerment appears rather instrumentalist and reversible. However, the SPC is in a position to promote its own agenda by indicating deference to core party goals and, in exchange, being granted certain leeway to pursue its institutional interests."

Justifying power: when autocracies talk about themselves and their opponents.,"Dukalskis, Alexander; Patane, Christopher",Contemporary Politics,Taylor & Francis Ltd,POLITICAL systems; CHINA; OPPONENTS; BENEFIT parties,authoritarianism; Autocracy; China; legitimation; repression,"It is commonly understood that authoritarian regimes attempt to legitimize their rule and de-legitimize opponents. What is less clear is the intensity with which they do so, whether (de-)legitimation varies by institutional structure, and whether and how this intensity varies in times of crisis. To address these questions, this article focuses on the types of messages that autocracies disseminate, how they vary across autocratic regime types, and how they change when confronted with system-challenging movements. The article tests expectations using quantitative events data on government statements, movements and state repression. It also examines a case of a single-party regime faced with a widespread protest movement, namely China in 1989, to investigate whether the quantitative findings manifest themselves in the dynamics of a particular episode. The article finds evidence that autocratic regimes regularly disseminate messages to legitimize their rule and de-legitimize opponents and that single-party regimes generally engage in more (de-)legitimizing rhetoric than other autocratic regime types both during ordinary times and times of regime crisis. In general, regimes scale up their (de-)legitimation efforts when they face a major system-challenging movement as well as when they choose to repress such movements."

Barth believes that human ethical action must be our free response to the Word of God in a covenantal relationship and thus be responsible to the rights of others. When addressing political issues, he resists all forms of hegemony, embraces a collective understanding of human rights, and urges their crucial importance for sustaining a humane political community. This article suggests that Barth's political ethics is helpful in reflecting on the lessons and prospects of collective right and resistance to Chinese neoliberalism."

The subject has gathered a lot of importance because of rising extremism that threatens national security of the Republic of Kazakhstan. The authors have posed themselves with the task of delineating the general provisions and specific situations related to the problem of extremism in Kazakhstan, as well as the measures needed to lower the level of radicalization of different population groups, first and foremost, the younger generations, and prevent their involvement in terrorist activities. This is achieved by accomplishing three tasks: to explain in which way the Arab Spring affected Central Asia, first and foremost, in the form of terrorist activities; to reveal the global nature of the problem of religious extremism, the measures needed to prevent its spread among the younger generation and the mechanisms of protecting our country against the ideas of terrorism; to create and improve the legal, normative, organizational and other mechanisms of power of the Republic of Kazakhstan designed to oppose the ideology of terrorism. We have concentrated on the driving forces, impacts of the Arab Spring, its role in the contemporary history of the Republic of Kazakhstan and deemed it absolutely necessary to pay particular attention to the place Kazakhstan occupies in the processes that are pushing the world towards a new world order. The type of radical activities in Kazakhstan, and in the Central Asian region for that matter, changed significantly under the pressure of the Middle Eastern crisis, which has been unfolding since 2011. Today, Syria and Iraq attract mercenaries from all corners of the world. The events in the Middle East forced many people to ask themselves whether the Arab Spring can be repeated in Central Asia; whether Arab revolutions can be continued there, how these processes might affect the region and, last but not least, how the Arab Spring echoed in other regions, what place Kazakhstan occupies and will occupy in the near future in the international balance of power and how this will affect the region's security. The impact of the Arab Spring, which is a multidimensional phenomenon, has spread far and wide outside the Middle East. This means that what happened and is happening there had already affected the interests of the United States, Russia, the European Union, Turkey, Iran, China and other countries which share Kazakhstan's international and geopolitical interests. Authors of hundreds of books, thousands of articles, monographs, academic papers and collections of articles published in different countries around the world have already discussed the economic and political impacts of the Arab Spring on Central Asia as a whole, and on Kazakhstan in particular. This is a topical subject that attracts attention of politicians and analysts of many countries. This article is our contribution to the common effort. We have posed ourselves with the task of examining the lessons of the Arab Spring from a different angle: having analyzed the lessons of the Arab Spring, we should work hard to prevent all sorts of threats and the spread of extremism and terror as the main challenges created by the Arab Spring."

Key legal challenges and opportunities in the implementation of the Nagoya Protocol: The case of China.,"Zheng, Xiaoou",Review of European Comparative & International Environmental Law,Wiley-Blackwell,ENVIRONMENTAL rights; CLIMATE change laws; ENVIRONMENTAL law; CONSERVATION of natural resources; CHINA; ENVIRONMENTAL protection planning,,"Since the Nagoya Protocol entered into force in 2014, the process of transposing international access and benefit‐sharing (ABS) standards into domestic contexts has been intensified in many countries. China became a party to the Nagoya Protocol in 2016. Being one of the mega‐biodiverse countries in the world, China nevertheless remains little known to international legal scholars of ABS‐related laws and regulations. This article aims to navigate this uncharted territory and examine the key legal challenges and opportunities in the process of implementing the Nagoya Protocol in China. Challenges with respect to the definition of key concepts, recognition of beneficiaries and potential approaches to benefit‐sharing are analysed in turn. Opportunities are investigated from both legal and institutional perspectives. The article proposes an integrated approach to legislate ABS under a comprehensive framework on biodiversity in order to sufficiently address the complexity and uniqueness of the Chinese national circumstances."

We analyze the above questions using a representative national dataset and argue that it depends on either 'Know Who' or 'Know How'. We further categorized three potential strategies in solving administrative dispute: Rule-bending, Rule-bound, and Rule-breaking. We find that while elites tend to approach the legal and bureaucratic system, encouraged by political connections, non-elites have to appeal outside the official justice system through petition. The findings herein suggest that China is pursuing regime stability through elite co-optation, which is in line with the theory of political survival."

This is particularly noticeable when it comes to the production of knowledge of a Global South self vis-à-vis the West. However, the literature has not seriously attended self-knowledge production in the Global South with regard to non-Western others. The paper compares South and Southeast Asian think tanks to reflect upon a common identity strategy of small nations to become a civilizational bridge between competing major neighbours. Specifically, China experts in these areas host more or less a common wish or even a desire to be a bridge over the difference of China and its potential rival in India, the West, or both. The bridge role is a rare sensibility in the postcolonial critique of the West. Watching China from its Southern Third World neighbourhood incurs such an agenda. Relying on interviews of retired diplomats and think tank experts, the paper also discusses how the above mentioned methodological characteristics affect the enactment of the bridge role."

The Four-Party Talks were proposed amid a crisis in the Taiwan Strait in 1996, and the Six-Party Talks were convened during the controversies over the subsequent Iraq War in early 2000s. The author argues whether this ""Ad-hoc Concert"" still survives as an analytic framework for examining Sino–US relations on the Korean Peninsula, notwithstanding the new dimension of collective security as a result of Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK, North Korea)'s nuclear issues with respect to the United Nation Security Council (UNSC). This paper first examines the Chinese initiatives in the nuclear crisis in 2016–17; it makes an assessment of the developments of the triangulated US–China–DPRK relationship after Chairman Kim Jongun referred to the ""denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula"" in early 2018. In the successive Summit meetings that Kim Jongun held with the Republic of Korea (ROK, South Korea)'s President Moon Jaein, and US President Donald Trump, the declaration to end the Korean War dominated those in the triangulated relations. This paper also reviews the controversies related to that declaration and their implication for Sino–US relations. Those implications will provide the basis for an analysis of Sino–US relations on the Korean Peninsula following a speech delivered by US Vice-President Mike Pence in October 2018 that was widely seen as a declaration of a ""new cold war"" between the US and China."

This contibution examines the special role of critical raw materials in the rivalry of the two countries. The analysis reveals the reliance of the United States on the supply of critical raw materials from China, which is a severe weakness of the US economy and military. The dependency leads to supply risks, undermines the American position in the conflict between the two countries and is an Achilles' heel that makes the US economy vulnerable. US politics seems to be aware of the risk, but their measures are not sufficient in order to reduce the supply risks and dependency associated with critical raw materials from China. A comprehensive and long-term oriented raw material strategy is required."

Financial fragility developed in the context of the transition from state feudalism to state capitalism. Cumulative causation and Keynesian uncertainty have meant that the main processes ensuring social stability, especially the state's ability to foster long-term capital accumulation, have also led to moral hazard and agency problems, especially in finance. Whether militant labor organizations can form a national movement as inward capital mobility lowers the wall between home and work remains an open question. Gabriel also does not address China's subordinate position in East Asian and Pacific capital circuits. He does lay bare the role of finance in the development of the Chinese modernist model in a unique and convincing manner."
Labour market characteristics and surviving import shocks.,"Chan, Jeff",World Economy,Wiley-Blackwell,LABOR market; INTERNATIONAL trade; MINIMUM wage; UNEMPLOYMENT insurance; EMPLOYMENT; UNITED States; CHINA,,"This paper investigates whether different labour market characteristics amplify or dampen the local labour market impacts from Chinese import competition exposure. I exploit state‐level variation in initial, pre‐shock labour market characteristics and regional variation across local labour markets in exposure to Chinese imports for identification. I find that local labour markets in states with higher union density experience more severe adverse consequences as a result of increased import exposure. Conversely, higher initial minimum wages help mute the negative impacts of the China shock. I also provide some evidence that exceptions to employment‐at‐will legislation can affect employment responses to increased Chinese imports. Finally, examining all policies together in an index, I show that higher levels of policies intended to benefit and protect workers can actually magnify the extent of the damage inflicted by import competition. My results suggest that initial labour market characteristics and policies can play an important role in understanding why local labour markets react differently to trade shocks."

In the Global North, empirical studies have scrutinized the link between irregular migration and labour trafficking, yet empirical studies that focus on labour schemes involving regular migrants remain scarce. Drawing on a qualitative analysis of 8 investigative police files of labour trafficking involving regular migrants in the Chinese catering industry in the Netherlands, this study investigates the mechanisms through which exploitation comes about and is sustained. It is concluded that exploitation is the result of the ways in which both the employers and the victims manoeuvre the space provided by immigration policies. Employer-bounded residence and work permits emerged as an especially important contributor to the initiation and continuation of exploitative situations. Policymakers should be highly aware of the vulnerabilities of temporary labour migrants' positions created by such policy arrangements. Future research is needed in order to create a better understanding of how exploitative work situations develop and are sustained, and the role different factors such as immigration policies play in such processes."

Our findings are robust to various refinements in measurement and model specification. These findings contribute to the general literature on land and democratization as well as the recent debate about competitive elections in authoritarian countries."

Latin America and the AIIB: Interests and Viewpoints.,"Mendez, Alvaro",Global Policy,Wiley-Blackwell,BEIJING (China); TIME perception; INVESTMENT banking; MYOPIA; LATIN Americans; LETTER writing,,"This essay gives insight into the interaction of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) with Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC). The AIIB has expressed a clear interest in LAC, accepting eight countries as 'prospective' members pending paying‐in their capital, but LAC shows almost no stamina. It is the world's only region lacking even one paid‐in member. So long as Beijing backs the request, prospective membership only requires writing a few letters. But LAC's inertia in officially joining, by passing legislation and making their capital contribution, is puzzling, given the benefits that lie untapped. The likeliest cause is their own culture of sheer negligent short‐sightedness ('let's do it mañana'). This tendency to adjourn the acid test of action could be mitigated if countries in the region adopt long‐term non‐partisan National Development Plans to strengthen their institutional policy‐making capacity. For their part, the AIIB's Governors and Beijing, despite their initial keen interest in LAC, have had to give up nudging and adapt themselves to the Latin Americans' labile perception of time in order to conserve their public image. They must remind LAC that only paid‐in members receive financial benefits. The AIIB could continue to engage the region and quietly by clarifying that the AIIB is not the BRI; and that the Bank is not China but a multilateral organisation of its own."

This article examines this topic, based on a conceptual framework that links internal, external and personal elements of authors such as James Rosenau, Valerie Hudson, Robert Russell and Juan Tokatlian. The analysis takes into account regional differences, the role of powers of different rank such as Brazil, Mexico and Colombia to demonstrate the importance of presidentialist emphases and preferences, although some of them are more rhetorical than real. The changes and continuities of Latin American foreign policy are considered, taking into account various sub-regions, and domestic agendas of interaction with the international. The United States continues to be the main reference for the foreign policy of the region. However, this power has been losing space that has been filled by countries such as China, India, Japan and Russia. The article concludes that Latin American changes are more political, conjunctural and pragmatic, and there is a tendency towards the construction of a New Right that is articulated with US hegemonic interests."

If the rise of China is inevitable, what will the future world look like, and what should other countries be prepared for? Borrowing insights from institutional balancing theory and role theory in foreign policy analysis, this project introduces a 'leadership transition' framework to explain policy dynamics in global governance, with the AIIB as a case study. It suggests that China, the United States, and other countries have employed different types of institutional balancing strategies, i.e. inclusive institutional balancing, exclusive institutional balancing, and inter-institutional balancing, to compete for influence and interest in the process of establishing the AIIB. A state's role identity as a 'leader', a 'challenger', or a 'follower' will shape its policy choices in global governance regarding different institutional balancing strategies in the process of 'leadership transition.' Institutional balancing is a new type of balancing among states in the future transformation of global governance. China's institutional rise in global governance, therefore, might be more peaceful than widely predicted."

The existing literature mostly assumes that coproduction requires additional costs from the public. This article explores whether and how digital technologies, which arguably have the ability to reframe public participation, might influence coproduction between the government and the public. A revised theoretical framework for coproduction in the era of digital governance is illustrated through a case study of the ""Visit Once"" administrative service reform in Zhejiang Province, China. This study reveals a new possibility for coproduction through digital technologies, in which citizens are involved in service improvement when using public services without costing them extra time or effort. Thus, the assumption of the necessity of additional costs from the public could be relaxed in the digital governance era. These findings also suggest that the significance of facilitative leadership in leading to coproduction can be moderated by digital technologies."

From an educational perspective, teachers take on an essential role in the implementation of education policies designed to cultivate students who are 'good citizens'. This research employed a mixed-methods approach to examine Hong Kong teachers' perceptions of 'good citizens' based on their affinity with democratic and patriotic values. The findings indicated that rather than conflicting, patriotic values tended to be complementary to democratic values. Moreover, critical patriotic citizens with multiple identities who participate rationally and constructively in social and political activities might be more likely to facilitate democratic development in Hong Kong. These findings have implications for policy-makers responsible for the citizenship education and preparation of future citizens living within polarized and pluralistic societies, and they highlight the value of learning to live together in a complex world."
Learning to Share? A Cold War Solution for Denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula.,"Connolly, Daniel; Hynd, Alexander M.",North Korean Review,"McFarland & Company, Inc.","COLD War, 1945-1991; NUCLEAR warfare; NORTH Korea; KOREA; COLD adaptation; NUCLEAR models; PENINSULAS",denuclearization; North Korea; nuclear sharing; reverse sharing,"Purpose—This paper outlines how reverse nuclear sharing between North Korea and China, inspired by Cold War nuclear sharing agreements, could contribute to the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. Design, Methodology, Approach—After a critical evaluation of existing proposals, this paper surveys bilateral nuclear sharing between the U.S. and its allies and highlights its potential utility in working toward a resolution of the North Korean nuclear crisis. Findings—Existing proposals for North Korean denuclearization are zero-sum approaches that fail to adequately take geopolitical context into account. Nuclear sharing agreements between the U.S. and its allies were successful in preventing proliferation and reassuring allies. Some of these features can be recreated in Northeast Asia by adapting the model to China and North Korea. Practical Implications—This paper outlines an attempt to find a compromise solution that can inform policy debates on North Korean denuclearization. Originality, Value—This is the first paper to propose an innovative adaptation of the Cold War nuclear sharing model to the Sino–North Korean relationship as a preliminary step toward denuclearization."
"Legal Mediators: British consuls in Tengyue (western Yunnan) and the Burma-China frontier region, 1899–1931.","WHEWELL, EMILY",Modern Asian Studies,Cambridge University Press,CONSULS; DIPLOMATIC & consular service; IMPERIALISM; BRITISH colonies; CHINA -- Foreign relations -- Great Britain,,"British consuls were key agents for the British imperial presence in China from 1842 to 1943. Their role, which was to perform administrative duties that protected the rights of British subjects, is most prominently remembered in connection with the east coast. Here larger foreign communities and international maritime trade necessitated their presence. However, British consuls were also posted to the far southwest province of Yunnan and the Burma-China frontier region. This article sheds light on the role of consuls working in the little-known British consular station of Tengyue, situated close to the Burma-China frontier. Using the reports of locally stationed consuls and Burmese frontier officials, it argues that consuls were important mediators of legal power operating at the fringes of empire for British imperial and colonial interests in this region. They represented British and European subjects, and were mediators in legal disputes between British Burma and China, helping to smooth over Sino-British relations and promoting British Burmese sovereign interests. The article serves to shift our attention from the British presence in China on the east coast to the southwestern frontier, demonstrate the importance of consular legal duties, and emphasize the trans-imperial nature of British legal roles across this region."
LEGAL PLURALISM AND ISOMORPHISM IN GLOBAL FINANCIAL REGULATION: THE CASE OF OTC DERIVATIVE COUNTERPARTY RISK REGULATION IN CHINA.,SIMIN GAO,George Washington International Law Review,George Washington International Law Review,LEGAL pluralism; COMMERCIAL law; INSTITUTIONAL isomorphism; FINANCIAL services industry -- Law & legislation; OVER-the-counter markets; COUNTERPARTY risk; FINANCIAL risk laws; CHINA,,"As economic globalization grows and legal conflicts between statemade domestic law and private-made transactional law become unavoidable, the core concepts instated by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) master agreement such as the close-out setoff mechanism become touchstones for different legal systems in different countries. The close-out setoff, which aims to reduce counterparty risk in the event of counterparty default, may come into conflict with existing bankruptcy law, as is the case for China. China has used a unique deference method to reconcile conflicting state laws and international norms in derivatives trade by localizing the ISDA master agreement and devising the master agreement of the National Association of Financial Market Institutional Investors (NAFMII). The NAFMII master agreement adopted all essential concepts of the ISDA master agreement including the close-out setoff that conflicts with Chinese Enterprise Bankruptcy Law. This Article studies some of the rulings on the legal standing of close-out setoff adjudicated by Chinese provincial courts and the relevant judicial interpretations of the Chinese Supreme Court. This Article also explores how China keeps abreast with the international trend by using mandatory central clearing as an alternative means of reducing counterparty risk. Furthermore, the Theory of Isomorphism is used to explain the driving force behind reconciling legal conflicts in the Chinese derivatives market. The analysis advanced here sheds light on the longstanding debate over conflict resolution in public-private ordering at the transnational and national levels. The analysis provided in this Article may help international finance regulators, lawyers, scholars, and policymakers understand how international financial norms and rules become integrated into domestic law."

Legislative Rules in Electoral Authoritarian Regimes: The Case of Hong Kong's Legislative Council.,"Smyth, Regina; Bianco, William; Chan, Kwan Nok",Journal of Politics,University of Chicago Press,PARLIAMENTARY practice; POLITICAL opposition; AUTHORITARIANISM; HONG Kong (China). Legislative Council; HONG Kong (China) -- Politics & government -- 1997-,,"This article focuses on the manipulation of legislative rules in electoral authoritarian states. Electoral liberalization in authoritarian regimes creates the capacity for opposition forces to win legislative seats, but it does not ensure voice in the policy process. While the literature on institutional authoritarianism points to co-optation, dominant parties, and redistribution as mechanisms to control policy outcomes in authoritarian legislatures, we investigate an additional possibility: that electoral authoritarian regimes (EARs) select legislative institutions that allow free debate and unconstrained voting yet decouple electoral success from policy influence. Our analysis centers on the EAR in Hong Kong and its legislature, the Legislative Council (LegCo). We find that the LegCo's rules of procedure interact with electoral institutions to create considerable roadblocks to opposition initiatives, while at the same time facilitating the enactment of regime policies."
Leninism and Local Interests: How Cities in China Benefit from Concurrent Leadership Appointments.,"Bulman, David J.; Jaros, Kyle A.",Studies in Comparative International Development,Springer Nature,EXCLUSIVE & concurrent legislative powers; CENTRAL-local government relations; LENINISM; POLITICAL systems; PROVINCIAL governments; POLITICAL parties; CHINA; CHINESE provinces,Central-local relations; China; Concurrent appointments; Nomenklatura,"The practice in Leninist political systems of assigning local leaders concurrent seats on higher-level leadership bodies presents a puzzle. In China, for example, a subset of provincial leaders hold seats in the central Politburo, while some city-level leaders hold seats in provincial party standing committees (PPSCs). While some scholars view these concurrent appointments as a form of top-down control or co-optation, others see these arrangements as a reflection of local power and a channel for the assertion of local interests. In this paper, we attempt to adjudicate between these different views empirically by analyzing the patterns and consequences of concurrent appointments of city leaders to China's PPSCs. We introduce a new typology that distinguishes between the political and economic functions of concurrent appointments to differentiate four possible intergovernmental dynamics of control, co-optation, compromise, and concession. Through analysis of an original dataset on PPSC appointments and case studies of three Chinese cities, we show that concurrent appointments in China's provinces can function as a means of concession, compromise, or co-optation, but we find little evidence that concurrent appointments allow higher-level authorities to firmly control or economically exploit localities."

Using an exploratory analysis that relied on documentary data, as complemented by insights from Key Informant Interview (KII), the paper observed that the incidence of SALWs proliferation was one of the factors that complicated the Liberian crisis. The paper posits that the complications of SALWs proliferation in Liberia during and after the National crisis (1989-2003) posed a threat to the country’s national security. The threat is evident in the collateral impact of armed violence that characterized the Liberian crisis as well as the wave of armed criminality that has punctuated the country’s history in the aftermath of the crisis. In the light of its dire effects vis-à-vis sustainable peace, security and stability, this paper submit that SALWs proliferation has posed a threat to Liberian national security both in the conflict and post-conflict eras."
Life History and System Justification: Higher Individual Fertility and Lower Provincial Life Expectancy Correlate With Stronger Progovernment Attitudes in China.,"Zhang, Jinguang; Zhong, Zhijin",Political Psychology,Wiley-Blackwell,SOCIAL services; MUNICIPAL services; POLITICAL psychology; CHINA; LIFE expectancy; LIFE history; FERTILITY,censorship; individual fertility; life expectancy; life‐history strategies; status‐legitimacy effect; system justification,"System justification theory posits that people sometimes legitimize current social arrangements at their own cost. Indeed, research showed that lower socioeconomic status (SES) correlates with stronger progovernment attitudes, but this correlation does not appear reliable. This research proposes a different class of correlates of progovernment attitudes drawing on life history (LH) theory. People who pursue a faster LH strategy (e.g., reproducing earlier and in larger quantities) should be more progovernment because their lower resource‐accruing potential makes them more dependent on government support (e.g., public services and social welfare) to raise a large family. Supporting this hypothesis, Chinese respondents' individual fertility positively correlated with confidence in government (Study 1) and partially mediated the negative correlation between provincial life expectancy and support of censoring government criticisms (Study 2). These findings suggest an alternative explanation to some of the correlations between SES and progovernment attitudes, provide a new mechanism of system justification, and add to the growing body of work on LH strategy and political psychology."

Comparative network analysis of data from a mental health services network in the US and a community-based elderly care network in China showed consistent support for the linkage between service provider cliques and joint administrative advocacy. Theoretically, it advances the study of advocacy coalitions by highlighting the nuanced effects of service provider cliques on advocacy partnerships."
"Linking anticorruption threats, performance pay, administrative outputs, and policy outcomes in China.","Liang, Jiaqi; Langbein, Laura",Public Administration,Wiley-Blackwell,PUBLIC sector; CORRUPTION; LABOR incentives; AIR pollution; CHINA,,"Little is known about the effects of two prominent public sector reforms—anticorruption efforts and high‐powered incentive systems—on the accomplishment of policy goals in the absence of the rule of law and in the presence of an extrinsic incentive to take advantage of corruption to achieve performance targets. This study explores how performance rewards and anticorruption efforts jointly affect administrative outputs and policy outcomes. We examine China's air pollution control policy with province‐level panel data. The analysis shows that performance rewards prompt administrative outputs that are linked to the incentive structure. Anticorruption activities have small significant, positive effects on those outputs only prior to the inception of high‐powered rewards, but have no significant effect on policy outcomes, regardless of the measure. The introduction of performance incentives contributes to the achievement of policy outcomes only when their measurement is subject to government manipulation."
Linking transformational leadership and value congruence among Chinese police force: The mediating role of goal clarity and the moderating role of public service motivation.,"Bao, Yuanjie; Ge, Leilei",Australian Journal of Public Administration,Wiley-Blackwell,TRANSFORMATIONAL leadership; VALUE congruence; POLICE; CIVIL service; PUBLIC administration; EMPIRICAL research; CHINA,goal clarity; public service motivation; transformational leadership; value congruence,"Although claimed as an important value assimilating factor within public administration, transformational leadership's effect over value congruence receives limited empirical investigation. Furthermore, the underlying mechanism and boundary condition of this effect are underspecified. Drawing from an interactionist perspective whereby value congruence is the joint product of situational influence and individual characteristic, this study investigates the relationship between transformational leadership and value congruence focusing on the mediating role of goal clarity and the moderating role of public service motivation (PSM). The analysis of data collected from a sample of 420 Chinese police officers indicates that goal clarity partially mediates the relationship between transformational leadership and value congruence. In addition, PSM moderates the relationship between goal clarity and value congruence such that the relationship is stronger when PSM is high. Finally, theoretical and practical implications are discussed. Although the value assimilating effect of transformational leadership is long claimed within public administration, empirical validation is scant. This study validated this claim by relating transformational leadership to value congruence among a sample of Chinese police officers. Important theoretical and practical implications are discussed."
Local Agency and Complex Power Shifts in the Era of Belt and Road: Perceptions of Chinese Aid in the South Pacific.,"Pan, Chengxin; Clarke, Matthew; Loy-Wilson, Sophie",Journal of Contemporary China,Taylor & Francis Ltd,SOCIAL sciences; ECONOMIC development; GEOPOLITICS; PAPUA New Guinea; AUSTRALIA-China relations; SILK Road,,"Beijing's ambitious Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) has exacerbated a longstanding concern about the power shift from the West to China. The existing debate, however, is both motivated by, and fixated on, the strategic concerns of and about great powers (and to a lesser extent, middle powers). What is often overlooked is the concerns and voices of smaller countries and contested regions where some of the power-shift symptoms allegedly unfold, such as the South Pacific. To traditional donors such as Australia, the power dynamism in the South Pacific is largely a linear, two-way model of power shift from Western donors to Beijing. Challenging this model, this article proposes a complex, three-way model to bring small and seemingly passive actors into the power shift equation. To illustrate, the article uses Papua New Guinea's (PNG) perceptions of China's aid vis-à-vis Australia's aid as a case study. Relying mostly on primary (interview) sources, this study not only reveals some nuanced attitudes of local actors toward the great-power interactions, but also highlights the hitherto neglected role and agency of Pacific Island nations and their domestic politics in the inherently complex power shifts."

Existing literature has documented the effects of public service accessibility on housing prices. However, few studies have examined how public service provision affects housing prices under the Chinese centralized governance system. Using data from different geographic scales, this study uses a multilevel research design to examine how public service provision is associated with housing prices in Shanghai. Results show that though the total expenditure at the urban district level is not related to housing prices, government redistributive expenditure is positively associated with housing price and the developmental expenditure is on the opposite. The expenditure effects are further mediated by the accessibility to public facilities at the community level. The findings suggest that, as public service accessibility has been capitalized into housing prices, the decentralized fiscal system with relatively centralized governance structure may have reinforced urban polarization in Shanghai."

In this paper, I argue that local governments can mitigate the risk of ethnic conflicts by increasing their provision of public goods. I situate this argument in the context of ongoing ethnic conflicts in Xinjiang, China. With a new data set of 105 ethnic conflicts in Xinjiang between 1997 and 2005, this study finds that counties with higher government spending on education were significantly less likely to experience conflicts. The results are robust to a wide range of robustness checks."

We approach the structure as a social network of members of parliament and interpret the memberships as proxy indicators of their interests/preferences in foreign affairs. This research shows that interparliamentary groups construct a self-sustained independent structure for parliamentary diplomacy which may significantly differ from the official positions of the government. We find that the studied network has a centralized core–periphery structure, in which deputies who are less prominent and those interested in authoritarian regimes occupy more central positions. This research connects the findings with the current debates on Central European tendencies to look for allies in large authoritarian regimes (Russia and China), for which we argue the interparliamentary groups might play the role of an important communication channel."

Could US accommodation of their status concerns reduce conflict? The psychological rationale for status accommodation is rooted in the insights of social identity theory (SIT), which argues that persistent status denial leads lower-status groups to ""lash out."" Steven Ward (2017) objects that political scientists have misinterpreted SIT. In his view, impermeable group boundaries only affect individuals and do not lead to intergroup conflict. Ward's narrow critique overlooks the larger meaning and significance of SIT, which is about how frustration and anger over status barriers and unfair treatment motivate lower-status groups to challenge the status quo. Social competition is positional and zero-sum. Given the insights of SIT, Ward's recommendation that the United States demonstrate to China and Russia the futility of status competition is likely to provoke a backlash and increase the risk of military conflict. Instead, SIT implies a continuing process of status accommodation and efforts to maintain the legitimacy and stability of US leadership."

Looking for a new grand strategy that will determine the U.S. position in world politics, Washington keeps sending Turkey mixed signals and the two allies are often lost in translation while trying to gain each other's support to fulfil their national priorities. Different than various other studies on Turkish-American relations, this article makes a unique contribution to the field by focusing mainly on systemic variables while analyzing U.S. relations with Ankara, which have followed a fluctuating course during the Obama and Trump administrations. It argues that the deteriorating relations are actually a result of the American retrenchment in the Middle East and its pivoting to Asia due to the world's shifting center of gravity from the West to the East with the rise of China."

These partnerships bring together state and business actors to export overcapacity and address infrastructural demands in underdeveloped markets. To do so, they require accumulation and sovereignty regimes that mirror, in contingent ways, similar social arrangements within China. The superposition of such regimes and the interests and social imaginaries of local actors produces forms of uneven and combined development and shapes the contours of the BRI's emerging developmental and geoeconomic footprints. The BRI exports also an elite development paradigm which promotes urbanization, connectivity and economic growth over participatory approaches. This paradigm projects a depoliticized version of China's present into the BRI's future to justify social and environmental dislocations, and shields Chinese firms from civil society scrutiny. My analysis rejects this elite perspective and favors a labor-centric approach that unearths the social foundations of the BRI. From this perspective, despite relevant differences in format, the BRI's quintessential investment modality is closely aligned to a contemporary global current of public-private partnerships endeavored to mobilize public resources and state power for the expansion of capitalist social relations."

Supplementing intensive fieldwork (carried out in Xinjiang in 2016) with archival research and analysis of the Kashgar redevelopment project (2001–2017), this article examines how urban planning has been used in the Chinese government's pursuit of securitization in ethnic minority concentrated regions. This article argues that the space-making of securitization in China has involved a combination of political rationality, administrative techniques and material (re)construction. Securitization reflects the state's invention of, and reaction to, a 'package of risks' in which various forms of security and intervention are interconnected and mutually constructed to produce hybrid political structures of governance. Moreover, this article employs the notion of volumetric politics to analyze the interrelationship between space and securitization in the case of Kashgar's old town redevelopment, and argues that this volumetric approach can be used (in a non-military and mundane context) to understand how securitization works through the everyday spaces of politics. Furthermore, this article argues that even in China's special political environment, securitization is embedded in the ongoing dynamics of domination and negotiation, the outcome of which is not necessarily a zero-sum-game between a strong state and the vulnerable recipients of the state actions of securitization. Accordingly, this article explores the interconnections between the literature on urban security, urban geopolitics, wider work in political and cultural geography, and critical terrorism studies."

The influx of Chinese investment along with Chinese construction workers, engineers, and equipment has led scholars and observers to question whether there a distinct model of Chinese infrastructure development. Does China take an integrated approach in Latin America — financing, designing, and executing projects — or does it operate as any other foreign country or company? We develop the concept of infrastructure dominance to answer these questions. Using data on over 400 of the most important public infrastructure projects, we find that China's involvement in projects varies based on the existing institutional constraints of the host country. Where countries have strong institutions, Chinese companies play a role similar to that of other foreign entities involved in infrastructure development. In Latin American countries with weak infrastructure institutions, however, China plays a very different role — it tends to dominate projects. Thus, this paper highlights the adaptability of the Chinese approach and the importance of domestic institutions for shaping the nature of infrastructure development."

Soon after, they announced their decision to favor a Chinese offer that came complete with licensed production and the promise of technology transfer. Yet, with this decision came NATO's objections and challenges around integration and information security. The 2015 decision to rollback the pro-China decision, and opt instead for the indigenous development of air and missile defense systems (in close conjunction with a foreign technological and industrial partner) was triggered by Turkey's disillusion with the content of China's technology transfer package. Subsequently, this new partner became a team comprising France and Italy; Turkish industry tied itself to this team in developing Europe's next-generation missile defense capability. Then came the Turkish government's 2017 decision to purchase off-the-shelf, standalone S-400 systems from Russia. This decision was an anomaly, and had all the characteristics of a top-down decision cycle running afoul of technical, operational, and industrial criteria. Turkey's political figures have justified the S-400 order by citing the benefits of in-country production, access to technologies, not to mention the West's refusal to sell comparable systems; but these justifications have been refuted by the Russian side and/or in discordant statements by Turkish institutions, authorities, and political figures themselves."

The functionalist approach maintains that the political vision is to build a Chinese-style ""active society"" that rises above the ""under-organized society"" of traditional China and the ""over-organized society"" of contemporary China simultaneously. An active society has three principal sociopolitical functions: inhibiting ""state fetishism,"" and defending the public sphere to promote the legitimation of state power; resisting ""market society,"" creating a market (re-)embedded in society and ensuring nonmarket supply of public goods; and rising above ""the differential mode of association"" (chaxu geju), accumulating social capital and nurturing civil virtues."

The Malaysian society is seen as a complex multi-entity construct, constituted by often sharply differentiated fragments and sub-fragments which could exhibit vastly different responses to the implications of the rise of China. Within such a construct, perception of the rise of China and the appropriate Malaysian response are intricately entwined with domestic power politics, generational transition and governmental control over public discourse. Hence, the Malaysian perception of the contemporary rise of China is as complex as the Malaysian society itself, and what is revealed in official government policies and public discourses in the dominant mass media would fail to reflect the real depth of the issue if the intrinsic complexity of the Malaysian society is not taken into due consideration."

I adopt a different approach by looking into the decision‐making process of Malaysia's China policy during Najib Razak's administration (2009–2018). I explain that the China policy decision‐making process under Najib was divided into two channels, one focusing on nonsecurity matters and the other on security matters, with the prime minister seated at the top of the two channels, while there were very little interactions between the two channels. These characteristics could partially explain the nature and outcome of Malaysia's South China Sea policy posture."

We believe that the local officials use both ""hard"" and ""soft"" measures to exercise control over these activities. The soft measures include persuasion and negotiation aimed at getting petitioners to abandon their irregular petitions. The hard measures involve the use of the coercive power of the state to compel the petitioners to return home. During important political meetings and holiday periods, both of which are popular times for petitioning, the CCP is more likely to take a hard approach to resolve serious problems and maintain stability. In normal times, it generally uses less costly soft tricks. These two social control strategies are utilized alternately by the CCP to maintain social stability and guarantee its regime survival."
Managing the 1986-87 Sino-Indian Sumdorong Chu Crisis.,"Pardesi, Manjeet S.",India Review,Taylor & Francis Ltd,"GEOPOLITICS; HISTORICAL revisionism; SINO-Indian Border Dispute, 1957-; CHINA-India relations; SINO-Soviet Border Conflict, 1969",,"How did China and India manage to prevent the 1986-87 Sumdorong Chu Crisis from escalating into a war? I argue that it was a combination of changing geopolitical factors (Sino-Soviet rapprochement and the end of Soviet support for India in the context of Sino-Indian tensions) and military factors (conventional deterrence and perceptions of limited revisionism) that help explain crisis management. While these geopolitical and military factors helped avert immediate escalation, the crisis truly ended only after China and India sought a new modus vivendi during Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's landmark trip to China in December 1988. The absence of great power (Soviet) support meant that India had to make a costly signal to China in the form of Gandhi's trip that happened during the 1987-89 cycle of protests in Tibet against Chinese rule. Nevertheless, Gandhi's visit took place after India had demonstrated its military strength and resolve in its ability to defend the status quo on the border, and therefore should not be interpreted as a sign of weakness. In other words, I argue that successful deterrence requires broader foreign policy reorientation. At the same time, considerations of power (in the form of internal/external balancing) are central to strategic stability in the Sino-Indian dyad, and that any recourse to diplomacy that ignores the realities of military power is unlikely to be successful for crisis management."
"Manly Civilization in China: Harry R. Caldwell, the 'Blue Tiger', and the American Museum of Natural History.","CHAN, YING-KIT",Modern Asian Studies,Cambridge University Press,AMERICAN Museum of Natural History; METHODIST missions; CHRISTIAN missionaries; EVANGELISTIC work; MASCULINITY; NATURALISTS; HUNTING; HUNTERS,,"This article examines the transplantation of America's 'manly' civilization to 1920s Fujian, China, through the experiences of Harry R. Caldwell (1876–1970), a Methodist missionary whose hunting was central to his social evangelism. With his rifle, Caldwell protected Chinese villagers from man-eating tigers, taught them how to hunt tigers effectively, and enabled them to reconceptualize their relationships with tigers and nature. By engaging the American Museum of Natural History in his specimen collection and hunt for the mythical 'Blue Tiger', Caldwell introduced an economy of natural expeditions to the villagers who were hired to support the hunt. This article argues that Caldwell's experiences as both a missionary and a hunter in Fujian was an extension, or negotiation, of his rugged masculinity, which was fostered in his Tennessee home town. He identified as both a Christian and a hunter, and he did not see these parts of himself as distinct. A comparison between Caldwell and his contemporary, the British naturalist Arthur de Carle Sowerby (1885–1954), accentuates America's rugged masculinity by suggesting different national approaches to hunting and the growing professionalization of the naturalist."

To throw light on this issue, we use a biographical dataset of Chinese Communist Party Central Committee (CC) members from 1945 to 1982 to investigate the tradeoff faced by Mao Zedong in selecting his senior officials. Our results suggest that during the Cultural Revolution (1966–1976), the foundation and consolidation of the new regime lowered the payoff from subordinate competence, leading to the purging of competent CC members and their replacement by mediocre substitutes. Additional analyses of the competing mechanisms proposed by different theoretical models indicate further that capable young subordinates are more likely to be purged, possibly because they have more outside options (e.g., future hiring by the dictator's successor) and, hence, expend less effort on loyalty."
Mapping the evolution of the central government apparatus in China.,"Ma, Liang; Christensen, Tom",International Review of Administrative Sciences,"Sage Publications, Ltd.",FEDERAL government; ECONOMIC reform,central government; China; evolution; organizational structure; public sector reform,"The structure of political and administrative institutions is important for achieving public goals. It is not fixed, however, but may change as a result of environmental and cultural processes or because of changes in leadership. Structural changes in the central government apparatus feature prominently in the recent strand of reform and change literature, but we know little about structural changes in contexts other than Western democracies. In this article, we analyze the main types of and possible reasons for structural changes in the central government apparatus in China over the past 70 years. We find interesting patterns of structural change in line with administrative developments. Using the multiple perspectives of organization theory, these can be primarily explained by political cycles or action taken by the central leadership, but they have also been influenced by cultural elements, economic growth, and societal transformation. Points for practitioners: We document the key patterns of organizational restructuring in China's central government from 1949 to 2016. Political cycles and economic reform and development are found to be the key drivers of structural evolution. The results show that the political will of top leaders plays a crucial role in navigating structural reforms, yet institutional reforms are still largely confined to rhetoric and symbolism without substantively transforming the landscape of government architecture. Sustained structural reforms are difficult to achieve successfully, which suggests that alternative avenues may be required to streamline administrative processes and improve interagency coordination."

As SOG research increases, it is important to thoroughly review the topics and trajectory of research on SOG in China. This paper uses CiteSpace, a visual analysis software, to provide an up-to-date overview and systematic summary of the research topics, trajectory, and gaps in SOG research in China. SOG research in China is classified into four categories: SOG concepts, development paths, government reforms, and performance evaluations. This paper illustrates the underlying problems, such as unsystematic theoretical development, research perspectives, and deficiency of the integrated research on the development mechanism, prominent focuses, and practical applicability. We concluded by identifying new trends in SOG research in China regarding government–society relations and big data."

Escalating tensions over seas provoke questions about how historical and territorial conceptions of sovereignty map onto maritime areas, and the continuing effectiveness of the so‐called ""rules‐based order"" in maintaining regimes for deciding jurisdiction of islands, rocks and other maritime land features. The paper examines sovereignty claims and the international law of the sea across various cases, including the contested claims over Dokdo/Takeshima, Senkaku/Diaoyu Dao and China's nine‐dash line. These case studies reveal the tensions between two legal regimes: territorial rules of acquisition (sovereignty) and the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). This article concludes by considering the ways that the symbolic nature of these disputes has implications for the capacities of UNCLOS and other legal instruments in the US‐led ""rules‐based order"" to establish orderly relations among states in the maritime arena."

The growing responsiveness of the state to the request for protection of Chinese citizens and assets abroad made room for the initial development of Chinese PSCs' overseas operations. However, the policy makers' focus on political loyalty has inhibited the full-fledged maturation of China's private security industry. So far, large foreign PSCs have been the main beneficiaries of this situation. The future development of Chinese PSCs remains possible in a gradual and pragmatic way, but Chinese policy makers will have to deal with important diplomatic and political questions before the development of any ""Chinese Blackwater"" will be imaginable."

Mass Purges: Top-Down Accountability in Autocracy.,"MONTAGNES, B.

We contend that mass purges are an instrument of top-down accountability meant to motivate and screen a multitude of agents (e.g., single-party members, state bureaucrats). We show that the set of purged agents is well delineated in mild purges, whereas no performance indicator is a guarantee of safety in violent purges. The proportion of purged agents is non-monotonic in the intensity of violence. For the autocrat, increasing the intensity of violence always raises performance, but it improves the selection of subordinates only if violence is low to begin with. Hence, even absent de jure checks, the autocrat is de facto constrained by her subordinates' strategic behavior. We use historical (including the Soviet purges and the Cultural Revolution) and recent (the Erdogan purge) events to illustrate our key theoretical findings."

This is most demonstrated by the developing economic and political partnership between China and Saudi Arabia. This article offers an exploration of how Saudi Arabia has sought to use its relationship with China as a means of counterbalancing and limiting Iranian power projection in the region. It explores the triangular relationship between China, Saudi Arabia and Iran, and shows the growth in economic and political relations at the expense of established Sino-Iranian energy relations. Furthermore, it will illustrate how this relationship will have regional and international implications in the Gulf. This article demonstrates Saudi Arabia's influence in the Sino-Saudi relationship with reference to its position on the Iranian nuclear issue and UN Resolution 1929. It concludes that despite a failure for Saudi Arabia to directly influence Chinese decision-making processes, this event sets a precedent that will continue to mature as Sino-Saudi relations further deepen into a strong strategic partnership and will have repercussions for the balance of power in the Gulf and Middle East."

Medical disputes and mediation in China: Government and responsibility shifting.,"Zhang, Jing; Cai, Yongshun",China Information,"Sage Publications, Ltd.",MEDIATION -- Government policy; SOCIAL conflict; CONFLICT management,mediation; medical disputes; responsibility shifting; social conflicts; state intervention,"Because of the heavy burden that the resolution of social conflicts imposes on the Chinese government, the government is motivated to delegate or shift its conflict resolution responsibilities to specialized institutions, including social organizations. However, the effectiveness of responsibility shifting is conditional on the types of conflict and social contexts. Focusing on the resolution of medical disputes in China, this article examines the conditions under which the government can avoid direct and heavy involvement in dispute resolution. The government can effectively delegate the responsibility for resolving conflicts when the disputing parties perceive the mediation agencies as impartial. Having effective institutions thus limits government intervention to only a small number of disputes. This study is based on an analysis of 1351 medical disputes and about 80 interviews with parties involved in dispute resolution."
"Memes, narratives and the emergent US–China security dilemma.","Breuer, Adam; Johnston, Alastair Iain",Cambridge Review of International Affairs,Taylor & Francis Ltd,DURESS (Law); NATIONAL security; MEMES; CHINA-United States relations; UNITED States; GENEALOGY; SOCIAL media,,"All major theoretical approaches that explain the growing rivalry between the United States (US) and China share a common prediction: as tensions develop, the US and China will each construct a master narrative emphasizing zero-sum interests, the efficacy of coercion, and the perceived blamelessness of the Self for the Other's aggressions. However, the concrete process by which these narratives emerge has been neither explicitly theorized nor measured in practice. We theorize that in the digital media age, narratives emerge when 'memes'—discrete, widely circulated images/descriptions of the Self or Other—are connected into coherent stories that eventually coalesce into a master narrative of rivalry. We therefore argue that tracking the speed and spread of memes provides a useful indicator of security dilemma dynamics. To this end, we note that in the United States the US–China rivalry is associated with a prominent meme that describes China as 'challenging the international rules-based order' (RBO). We use qualitative and quantitative text analysis, including network and plagiarism analysis, to track the spread of this meme. We provide preliminary evidence that the RBO meme and the 'revisionist China' narrative may be crowding out other, less malign narratives about China's rise."

However, there has recently been a new way of dealing with this dilemma for local governments: called the 'Separation of Election and Employment' (xuan pin fenli, SEE) [of village cadres]. Based on an in-depth case study of a Zhejiang county, this article argues that SEE is a typical type of institutional layering, which adds a new meritocratic village cadre management system onto existing village democracy. This is a path-dependent institutional change, emulating the Chinese Communist Party's nomenklatura and bianzhi systems. This research has broader implications concerning gradual institutional change and political meritocracy."

While Pence was not asking anyone to choose between Washington and Beijing, he made it abundantly clear what he thought the best choice would be. While he did not rule out a restoration of good relations with Beijing - once it started behaving itself - most Asians heard his remarks, and those from Trump and other senior officials, as signals that a China-US Cold War had already begun. Meanwhile, the administration's preference for tariffs as the weapon of choice was seen not as a tool to bring about a ""free and open Indo-Pacific"" but as a sledgehammer aimed at persuading US firms to return to US protectionist shores. As the president and his team declared their love for bilateral trade deals, Asians pressed ahead with their own multilateral initiatives. Looking ahead, like it or not, the China-US relationship appears to be the dominating feature of the Indo-Pacific economic and security environment."

Accordingly, Sino-American presence in Africa has resulted in: (i) the militarization and securitization of Africa impelled by the war on terrorism and the need to protect vested political and economic interests; (ii) the continent becoming a theater for the interplay of differences between American and Chinese militarization and securitization; and (iii) the inevitable and rare cases of military and security cooperation between the two powers on the continent.

Why does the public respond less favourably to Chinese FDI than to FDI from other countries? We explore this question by conducting a series of survey experiments in Canada, where the majority of the public holds a negative opinion of Chinese investment. We find that the bias can be attributed to innumeracy about the relative size of China's FDI and misinformation about investment rules that govern FDI projects in Canada. Correcting both misperceptions substantially reduces the bias of respondents against FDI projects from China. These results suggest that corrective information can lead to positive change in public attitudes, a finding that has important policy implications for Canadian leaders hoping to expand the country's business ties with China."

Focusing on the so called ""currency wars"" debate that erupted in the early twenty-first century, when the PRC was accused of devaluating its currency, this article contends that PRC's representation as a prime currency manipulator and cheater can be conceptualised through what I am calling monetary Orientalism or the ways imperialising thoughts circulate around monetary flows in relation to a rising Asiatic superpower.

While elements of the relevant literature provide valuable insight, this article argues that the concepts of revisionism and the status quo within mainstream International Relations (IR) have always constituted deeply rooted, autobiographical narratives of a traditionally Western-dominated discipline. As 'ordering narratives' of morality and progress, they constrain and organize debate so that revisionism is typically conceived not merely as disruption, but as disruption from the non-West amidst a fundamentally moral Western order that represents civilizational progress. This often makes them inherently problematic and unreliable descriptors of the actors and behaviours they are designed to explain. After exploring the formations and development of these concepts throughout the IR tradition, the analysis is directed towards narratives around the contemporary 'rise' of China. Both scholarly and wider political narratives typically tell the story of revisionist challenges China presents to a US/Western-led status quo, promoting unduly binary divisions between the West and non-West, and tensions and suspicions in the international realm. The aim must be to develop a new language and logic that recognize the contingent, autobiographical nature of 'revisionist' and 'status quo' actors and behaviours."

This essay reviews some of the major problems pertaining to the logic of inquiry characteristic to this genre of analysis, its interpretation of historical evidence, and its neglect of alternative explanations of war - even those that Thucydides had written about in his account. There is a danger of self-fulfilling prophecy to the extent that leaders in Beijing and Washington are inclined to believe in an analogy to an ancient war that happened some 2500 years ago. Conventional invocations of Thucydides' Trap fail to recognize that there are several possible pathways to war. Because they offer only a structural explanation based on interstate power shifts, they give short shrift to the role of human agency and fail to attend sufficiently to what leaders can do to avoid conflict."

While China's rise raises worries for most neighboring states, it appears that for Russia, security concerns vis-à-vis the United States and NATO outweigh other considerations. Russo–Chinese military cooperation has increased through high-tech arms trade, bilateral exercises, and improved border relations. The article asks whether Moscow is downplaying a pragmatic partnership policy in favor of a more permanent strategic approach in its military policies toward China. By pursuing arms sales and bilateral exercises, Russia allows for vulnerability in its cooperation with China, indicating a strategic partnership. At the same time, deployments along the common border point to safeguarding and pragmatic elements, revealing a not fully coherent strategy."
Multilateral Development Finance in Non‐Western Thought: From Before Bretton Woods to Beyond.,"Helleiner, Eric",Development & Change,Wiley-Blackwell,"DEVELOPMENT banks; BRETTON Woods System; FINANCIAL institutions; SUN, Yat-sen, 1866-1925; HAYA de la Torre, Victor Raul, 1895-1979",,"Recent initiatives of China and other emerging powers to create new multilateral development lending institutions (MDLIs) are often portrayed as efforts to build upon and/or reform an idea pioneered by Western officials during the Bretton Woods negotiations. However, recent literature has shown that support for MDLIs also had deeper non‐Western roots in the pre‐Bretton Woods era. What led thinkers outside the West to propose MDLIs in that earlier period? How might their ideas be relevant to current non‐Western initiatives to create new MDLIs? This article addresses these questions with a special focus on the ideas of China's Sun Yat‐sen (1866–1925) and Peru's Víctor Raúl Haya de la Torre (1895–1979). Although their intellectual journeys were quite distinct and their specific proposals differed, these two thinkers advocated the creation of MDLIs for similar reasons that stemmed from their anti‐imperialist sentiments. Their ideas find some echoes in current non‐Western initiatives."
Multiple mechanisms of policy diffusion in China.,"Zhang, Youlang; Zhu, Xufeng",Public Management Review,Taylor & Francis Ltd,POLICY sciences; POLICY discourse; GOVERNMENT policy; POLICY diffusion; CHINA -- Politics & government,China; dyadic analysis; Policy diffusion,"An increased interest in policy diffusion research on China has emerged in recent years. However, the multiple diffusion mechanisms in China have not been explored adequately. In this research, we employ the directed dyadic event history analysis, a new approach introduced into recent policy diffusion research, to examine the diffusion of China's provincial level administrative licencing centres from 1999 to 2015. Our research provides consistent evidence that horizontal learning, imitation, and the vertical top-down diffusion mechanisms can coexist in China, which provides substantial empirical support for the application of policy diffusion theory in non-western countries."
Narrating China's belt and road initiative.,"Zeng, Jinghan",Global Policy,Wiley-Blackwell,"JIANGSU Sheng (China); CHINESE Communist Party; ROADS -- China; CHINA -- Foreign economic relations; XI, Jinping, 1953-",,"This article studies the formation process of China's belt and road initiative (BRI) – the most important Chinese foreign policy initiative under Xi Jinping. It argues that the BRI was put forward as a broad policy idea that was subsequently developed with relatively concrete content. During this process, the shifting international landscapes have gradually driven the BRI from a periphery strategy into a global initiative. By examining the case of Jiangsu Province, this article also shows how Chinese local governments have actively deployed their preferred narratives to influence and (re‐)interpret the BRI guidelines of the central government in order to advance their own interests. As a result, this produces a variety of competing, ambiguous and contradictory policy narratives of the BRI within China, which undermines the Chinese central government's monopoly on the BRI narratives. This leaves the BRI as a very vague and broad policy slogan that is subject to change and open to interpretation. In this regard, the existing analyses – that consider the BRI as Beijing's masterplan to achieve its geopolitical goals – pay insufficient attention to the BRI's domestic contestation and overstate the BRI's geopolitical implications. Even when it comes to significant national projects, such as the BRI, which are associated with the top leader Xi Jinping's personal authority and introduced into the Chinese Communist Party's constitution, Beijing's central agencies are often not fully capable of coordinating political actors within China and producing one unified official Chinese narrative."
Narrative stories in Chinese characters: political framing of ageing and welfare reform in China.,"Van Gerven, Minna",Policy & Society,Taylor & Francis Ltd,PUBLIC welfare; SOCIAL responsibility; LEGITIMATION (Sociology); WELL-being -- Religious aspects; ORGANIZATIONAL performance,ageing; China; framing; health; inequality; long-term care; narratives; welfare reform,"This article analyses narrative stories used by the Chinese government to connect the problem of population ageing to welfare reform. The findings derived from semi-structural interviews and key policy documents suggest the unfolding of the narrative stories of power and stories of rising and stories of decline. The narrative stories in the developmental Chinese welfare state are diverse and stem from different processes than those for the mature European welfare states. The Narrative stories also vary for different policy areas. For inequality and health-care policies, under the master narrative of story of power, state depicts 'stories of giving-to-give' to support expansion in the traditional 'old risk' type of policies to main population, including the elderly. For long-term care, the power narrative of 'giving-to-shape' legitimizes the expansionary reforms for a small group of deserving frail elderly. Behind this political framing of long-term care reform lies the story of decline that justifies the modest role of state provision in the organization of long-term care and leaves the responsibility for economic, social and spiritual wellbeing for the society itself. The story of decline in China also gravitates around sustainability of societies rather than around financial sustainability commonly underlining the political debate in the West."
"Nation, Migration, Identity: Learning from the Cross‐Strait Context.","Momesso, Lara; Lee, Chun‐yi",International Migration,Wiley-Blackwell,TRANSNATIONALISM; INTERNATIONAL marriage; GLOBALIZATION; SOVEREIGNTY; NATIONALISM; CHINA-Taiwan relations; CHINESE -- Migrations,,"It has been argued that globalization, with its flexible landscapes of production, consumption and mobility, has favoured the emergence of new forms of belonging that are not necessarily built on such principles of the nation state. In this article, we argue that this process is more likely to happen when movements occur between states that are not in conflictual relations with each other. When the relations between two nations are shaped by conflicts, for instance due to disputes about sovereignty over a territory, nationalism may remain a crucial factor shaping the identification and belonging of those who move between the two territories. In this article, by looking at the case of migrants moving between China and Taiwan, we will shed light on how the issue of ""unresolved sovereignty"" may eventually lead these actors to reinforce nationalist ideals and identities in their daily narratives, instead of favouring the generation of hybrid identities."
"National development through global production networks? The case of Dongguan, China.","Rolf, Steven",Political Geography,Elsevier B.V.,ECONOMICS; SOCIAL order; FOREIGN investments; NATION-state; CHINA; DONGGUAN Shi (China); GLOBAL production networks; MANUFACTURING processes,,"The wide-ranging implications of globalised production networks (GPNs) for national varieties of capitalism are only now beginning to be broached by political economists and human geographers. As production processes increasingly striate national political territories, an area in need of further research is the impact of GPNs on developing economies' state architectures — which have historically utilised state-owned or state-directed industries in pursuit of national development projects. The advent of GPNs radically altered the possibilities for such strategies by apparently undermining the ability of developing states to develop national champions — large, vertically integrated firms either nationally owned if not subject to great levels of state control. Does the preponderance of transnational production networks, SMEs, foreign direct investment, and export processing zones entail an end to the significance of national states and politics for development trajectories? Experience suggests otherwise, and a literature is beginning to theorise various forms by which statehood, sovereignty and politics continue to shape GPN-organised manufacturing. The reciprocal interactivity of networks and institutions remains in need of further research, however. This article probes these questions with reference to a detailed case study of the developmental experience of Dongguan city in China between 1978 and 2008. In this period, Dongguan (a major export manufacturing hub on the southern coast) came to the forefront of China's national strategy of export-led industrialisation — but simultaneously crystallised the rise of fragmented production. The city's industrialisation was governed by this contradictory dynamic – on the one hand, GPN-integration transformed its social and political order, while subsequent interventions by the provincial and national states aimed to envelop the city in the institutional framework of China's political economy."

The participants were asked to fill in a questionnaire and write down reasons why they 'like' or 'dislike' the four groups. The results showed a consistency in in-group favoritism. Gender and age were both related to Chinese youths' national identifications and their national intergroup attitudes. Confucian ethics, media influence and historical complex were identified as main factors that may contribute to their attitudes toward the four groups."
Nationalism vs. Interests: A Neoclassical Realist Perspective on Japan's Policy towards China under the Second Abe Administration.,"Zakowski, Karol",Pacific Focus,Wiley-Blackwell,"NATIONALISM; INTERNATIONAL relations; PRIME ministers; IDEOLOGICAL conflict; CHINA; JAPAN; ABE, Shinzo, 1954-",Abe Shinzō; China; Foreign policy; International relations; Japan; Nationalism; Neoclassical realism,"The aim of this article is to analyze the influence of Prime Minister Abe Shinzō's nationalist stance on Japan's policy towards China from a neoclassical realist perspective. It is argued that the extent to which Abe's ideological leaning exerted impact on foreign policy making depended on external stimuli, as well as Abe's domestic political interests. Prime Minister Abe generally perceived China as a threat to Japan, and remained assertive towards it, but he also pragmatically displayed flexibility in such areas as history issues, security policy, and territorial dispute. This article analyzes these complex developments in light of the changes in international environment and domestic politics, examining three periods: Abe's first administration (2006–2007); the escalation of diplomatic disputes with China (2012–2014); and gradual rapprochement with China (since 2014). It is concluded that the nationalist beliefs of decision makers affect foreign policy to the greatest extent whenever they are in line with other kinds of variables, such as external pressures and domestic interests."
Navigating two Asias: how Washington deals with the Indo-Pacific's rising powers.,"White, Joshua T.",India Review,Taylor & Francis Ltd,GREAT powers (International relations); INDO-Pacific Region; CHINA-India relations; CHINA-United States relations; INDIA-United States relations,,"The United States has sought over the last two decades to facilitate India's rise as a means of balancing against China's ambitions. Notwithstanding the rich literature that has emerged on Sino-Indian dynamics and the U.S.-India-China triad, there has been remarkably little examination of the ways in which the United States navigates its relationships with these two rising powers. This study poses a simple question: to what extent has the United States' pursuit of its interests with India meant that it has accepted trade-offs with respect to its interests with China? Drawing on government documents, interviews with current and former U.S. officials, and an array of case studies between 2005 and early 2019, this study argues first that the U.S. bureaucracy has long been structured in such a way as to heavily compartment policy decision-making related to South Asia and East Asia, respectively, and to produce a pronounced but largely explicable structural bias toward East Asia; second, that relatively few policy matters have arisen since 2005 that have forced the United States to consider meaningful trade-offs between its India and China equities; and third, that new challenges may arise for Washington as its deals with an increasingly inter-connected Indo-Pacific region, and manages the bureaucratic and policy implications of its renewed emphasis on great power competition."
"Neither Fair nor Efficient, but More Elitist: Meritocracy in Chinese Petroleum Firms' Graduate Recruitment and Selection.","He, Yuan; Makarchev, Nikita",Journal of Contemporary China,Taylor & Francis Ltd,MERITOCRACY; PETROLEUM industry; ELITE (Social sciences); SOCIAL systems; CHINA; EMPLOYEE selection; EMPLOYEE recruitment,,"This paper examines the concept and practice of meritocracy in Chinese national oil corporations' (NOCs) graduate recruitment and selection. It focuses on the post-2008 NOC reform period, which sees NOCs place increasing rhetorical emphasis on meritocratic or 'fair' recruitment and selection. However, this paper argues that, in practice, these sentiments remain unrealized. The NOCs continue to use some sub-optimum applicant assessment measures and misuse or misunderstand the more optimum ones. Likewise, the prioritization of certain criteria, such as elite education, has merely advantaged graduates with strong Bourdieu capitals. Hence, this produces a flawed meritocracy that neither maximizes fairness nor efficiency, but strengthens elitism. Moreover, its capacity to serve political interests is questionable too. These insights, then, enhance existing academic debates over China's engagement with meritocracy."

The present work highlights three aspects of this dynamic: the PCI's rewriting of its identity as a foreign policy making actor independent of the US and the USSR, and neither dismissive nor laudatory of Mao; the PCI's establishment of partnerships with actors at home and abroad to allow for its China-policy blueprints to come to fruition; and the efforts of PCI-affiliated intellectuals toward making a rapprochement between the PCI and the CCP possible."
New Boundary Work of Rural Migrants: How It Opens Up New Potential Ways of Remaking Rural-Urban Symbolic Boundaries in China.,"Chew, Matthew M.",Chinese Sociological Review,Taylor & Francis Ltd,IMMIGRANTS; CHINA; BEIJING (China); PARTICIPANT observation,,"There are powerful symbolic boundaries in urban China that exclude rural migrants. This study identifies and analyzes the new boundary work that aims at remaking these rural-urban boundaries. Based on data on previous cohorts of rural migrants in China and elsewhere, current studies argue that the predominant type of boundary work is personal assimilation. I challenge this finding by documenting how the most recent cohort of young rural migrants develop a broad variety of ""normative inversion,"" ""reclassification,"" and ""universalistic blurring"" types of boundary work. Although this study does not conclusively prove that the new boundary work has already successfully remade rural-urban boundaries, it illustrates that new potential paths to remaking them are opened. Data were mainly collected between 2014 and 2017 through participant observation in dance clubs in Beijing and interviews with fifty-seven dance club service workers."

The appointment of a new finance minister experienced in local government affairs is expected to renew the reform affirmed by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) congress in late 2017. China has unprecedentedly identified a comprehensive list of 81 national basic public services as entitlements. Eighteen of them are subject to national and local standards, and co-financed by central and local governments. A new cost-sharing method for 10 of these services classifies sub-national jurisdictions into five tiers, in which the central government's share declines from 80% to 10%. These measures, effective in 2019, aim at creating a 'harmonious and moderately prosperous society'."

The first measure requires cost benefit analysis in proposing public investment projects; the second requires local governments to make extensive disclosures before they could issue debt securities; and the third allows major international rating agencies to assess the creditworthiness of Chinese local government borrowers. Together, these steps represent China's steadfast expansion of institutional capacity and market efficiency. They are also evidence of China's continued adaptation of Western techniques in institutional capacity building to increase global competitiveness. In this article, the authors add to international understanding of how China improves the performance of its government and capital markets. For foreign policy-makers, especially those dealing with China directly, at the macro level this article points out the positive features of Chinese public policy-making and management, thus complementing or balancing the ideological and negative aspects often reported by the Western press. It points out that rational management is an almost invisible foundation supporting China's current ambitious domestic development and assertive foreign policy. At the micro level, this article seeks to arouse public management scholars' interest in Herbert Simon's concept of procedural rationality as an explanation of seemingly mindless bureaucratic process. Readers are encouraged to test the universality of the idea, which seems to operate in Chinese government. Since time immemorial Chinese officials search for 'latent rules' (qianguize) to ensure personal survival or get things done."

For the last couple of decades (post-U.S.S.R. disintegration period), voices have been heard from all over the world calling for a revival of the ancient Silk Road with an aim of enhanced overland commercial cohesiveness in the region connected/covered by it. However, the continuous war in Afghanistan over the course of the last three decades and uncertainty in Central Asia have continuously rendered the idea of revival unviable, up until the present time. Efforts aimed at the revival of the Silk Road seem to be gaining a renewed momentum lately. It is important to note that the present-day major international powers have their own, distinct concepts of the revival of the Silk Road that seem to be moving ahead at varying paces, operating parallel to each other, if not exactly coinciding. With all the above inferences, India is still in the process of expanding the association, which would eventually lead to close engagement with major powers. In the rapidly changing geopolitical scenario, some of the most important challenges for India are the adverse economic effects of world economy and energy security along with geocultural relevance in the context of Islamic State and fundamentalism. In this context, this paper aims to elaborate India's challenges and responses for a new Silk Road diplomacy."

To look into the 'low-end' society, this study uses intersectionality theory to analyse how the social categories of gender, social origin and occupation creates overlapped disadvantages for migrant women workers as domestic helpers in China. Before, little attention has been paid to these invisible building blocks of the great economic success of China, hence the multiple inequalities they have experienced in their lives and work are untold stories. Using intersectionality analysis, the study describes in detail the status of migrant women workers as domestic helpers. It further introduces Chinese laws and policies on Hukou regulation, on women's rights and on regulating the domestic service market, with a conclusion of the concrete problems faced by this group of people."
No Questions Asked?

Whereas the policy allows China to engage Africa's authoritarian dictators and democrats alike as it invests in energy, infrastructure, mining, and other projects without many restraints or preconditions; opposition groups across the continent have seized upon its presumed support for unpopular incumbent regimes to stir opposition to China among Africa's masses during recent elections. Unless China's policymakers modify their Africa policy, China's investments in Africa are ironically producing the conditions of development, such as the proliferation of cheap cellphone technology and an expanding African middle class, alongside increasingly dissenting voices over their strategy and presence in Africa."

Contemporary Evangelical missionaries working in Yunnan encourage the preservation of ethnic markers while attempting to create a form of 'pristine faith': a religiosity that severely limits the role of ethnicity in the construction of identity, emphasizing instead individualism and globalism—processes that may be beneficial for the Chinese state. My discussion here revolves around the distinction made by many Evangelical Christians in China between 'true' faith, based on an individual experience of salvation and rebirth, and 'nominal' faith, a traditional understanding of religion as an identity that is acquired at birth. Thus, minority Christians whose ancestors converted en masse prior to the 1949 revolution and retain a distinctly ethnic form of religiosity are often labelled 'nominal' by contemporary missionaries and converts. In contrast, the latter represent a faith that stems from personal experience and belongs to a global and transnational community, transcending the narrow limits of ethnic culture."

In authoritarian political systems, these challenges are pronounced because local governments do not face citizens at the polls. In a national‐scale, randomized field experiment in China, we test whether a public, non‐governmental rating of municipal governments' compliance with central mandates to disclose information about the management of pollution increased compliance. We find significant and positive treatment effects on compliance after only one year that persist with reinforcement into a second post‐treatment year. The public rating appears to decrease the costs of monitoring compliance for the central government without increasing public and media attention to pollution, highlighting when this mode of governance is likely to emerge. These results reveal important roles that nonstate actors can play in enhancing the accountability of local governments in authoritarian political systems."
Non-traditional security cooperation between China and south-east Asia: implications for Indo-Pacific geopolitics.,"Gong, Xue",International Affairs,Oxford University Press / USA,GEOPOLITICS; INTERNATIONAL relations; GREAT powers (International relations); INTERNATIONAL security; INTERNATIONAL cooperation; INDO-Pacific Region; ASEAN; CHINA -- Foreign relations,China; Indo-Pacific; international security; Non-traditional security; south-east Asia,"The 'free and open Indo-Pacific' (FOIP) strategy, actively promoted by the United States with support from its allies and partners, is a significant geopolitical response to China's growing power and expanding influence in Asia and beyond. Beijing has adopted various new strategies to cope with the challenges related to FOIP. One of these strategies is to secure a robust relationship with south-east Asia in order to make these regional states either neutral to or less supportive of the Indo-Pacific vision. In addition to economic statecraft and soft power, Beijing believes that it can also tap into the domain of non-traditional security (NTS) to strengthen relations with this region to position itself better in the intensifying regional geopolitical competition. The article addresses the following question: what is the impact of China's NTS cooperation with south-east Asia on Beijing's geopolitical rivalry with other major powers in the Indo-Pacific region? The article argues that China's NTS cooperation with south-east Asian countries may help China maintain its geopolitical standing in the region, but it is unlikely to lead to any dramatic increase of China's strategic influence in the region. This essentially means that Beijing may be able to prevent ASEAN or most ASEAN member states from lending substantive and strong support to the Indo-Pacific construct, but it will not be able to stop ASEAN states from supporting some elements of the FOIP."

To do so, it zooms in on a single infrastructure project, the Jakarta-Bandung high-speed rail line, which involved intense competition between China and Japan. Specifically, it examines how competition between China, a non-Western emerging power, and Japan, an OECD member, led to a recalibration of both China and Japan's approaches to infrastructure financing in the region. The findings suggest that rather than straight convergence or competition between diverging models, there is an ongoing process of two-way adjustment between China, and representatives of the dominant global norms and practices. We also argue that to understand the implications of China's participation in the field of international development, and its impact on the 'rules of the game' of global governance, researchers should avoid positioning inquiries within the premises of China's one-directional impact on the development assistance regime. Rather, it is necessary to take into account a complex set of relationships including China, host countries and other 'socialised' actors, and the process of negotiation between them."

It marked the end of political diversity and the decline of Soviet and Chinese influence on political, economic, and cultural developments in North Korea. Two incidents in particular, the August Plenum of the Korean Workers' Party, and the joint Sino-Soviet party intervention in a domestic dispute that September, propelled North Korea down the path toward despotism and isolation. Scholars have long suggested that North Korean leader Kim Il Sung faced serious and potentially perilous challenges to his position at the helm of the party-state during these two incidents. Utilising newly available Soviet and Chinese records, this paper challenges the standard narratives of the incidents, and asserts that there was no great threat to Kim's position, either from domestic opposition, or from intervening Soviet and Chinese officials. A fuller understanding of the events of 1956, and of North Korea's construction of a narrative to justify political repression, enables us to better comprehend the nature of the Kim Il Sung regime and its troubled relations with its patron allies throughout the remainder of the Cold War era."

Second, states have discovered the enormous potential of A.I. Even those that have an impoverished economy (like North Korea) are prepared to institute an expensive A.I. development program. Third, while A.I. is often discussed in the context of advanced economies (especially the U.S. and its leading technologies) and rapidly developing and emerging economies like China, the A.I. program of other smaller economies, including those perceived to be lagging, are often de-privileged in such analyses. Design, Methodology, Approach—This review essay and commentary tries to address gaps in the literature and hopes to provide insights into North Korea’s A.I. development through interpretive work, media reports and comparative analyses with A.I. developmental programs in other countries. A caveat is the secretive nature of North Korea and that it does not often have open and transparent public sharing of its strategic programs. Thus, secondary sources can only make conjectures, projections, observations, informed speculation and guesswork based on multiple sources that are corroborated to the best of the compiler’s ability. Findings—Even as the state pools together its maximum resources, however, there are limitations to the North Korean A.I. development program. A major problem is the acquisition of equipment that cannot be produced indigenously, given the presence of United Nations (UN) economic sanctions and the high costs of high performance computing and other equipment. Practical Implications—This writing is useful for North Korea watchers. It raises awareness of the topic of A.I. development in the reclusive country, and presents an interesting and value-added topic to examine an unconventional country’s unconventional objectives and priorities in A.I. development. Imagine the potential that can be unleashed for North Korea by giving up its nuclear weaponry and ballistic missile programs. North Korean A.I. development, when connected with the rest of the world, can take off even faster, judging by its promising start despite limitation of resources. North Korea may even enjoy being a latecomer (latecomer’s advantage) as it incorporates the latest technologies into its infrastructure and has access to lessons learned by earlier precedents. Even with scarce resources, North Korea has overcome challenges to produce cutting-edge A.I. algorithms like Eunbyul. one can only imagine the contributions talented North Korean programmers and coders can make to the local and global Industry 4.0 if they are provided with more resources and access to the global body of knowledge. Originality, Value—Very little has been written on this topic in the English language, beyond a handful of media reports. It is a de-privileged and under-studied topic in North Korean studies, despite its important implications."
Northeast Asian Perspectives on China's Belt Road Initiative: the View from South Korea.,"Hwang, Balbina Y.",East Asia: An International Quarterly,Springer Nature,"SOCIAL stability; BELT & Road Initiative; INTERNATIONAL relations; SOUTH Korea; CHINA; MOON Jae-in; PARK, Geun-hye, 1952-",Belt and road initiative; Eurasia initiative; New southern policy; South Korea,"This article examines South Korea's response to BRI, focusing on former President Park Geun-hye's ""Eurasia Initiative"" as well as current President Moon Jae-In's ""New Southern Policy."" Given Beijing's preoccupation with political and social stability both domestically as well as in neighboring countries, it argues that there is little doubt that for Beijing economic goals are subordinate components of broader national goals, which in turn formulate the basis for geopolitical calculations. BRI represents an attempt by Beijing's leadership to shape the rules and norms governing the surrounding regions to better reflect their own preferences. Following Xi Jinping's launch of BRI, Seoul announced the Eurasia Initiative (EAI) as its own vision for an East-West connection. In calling for a revival of the ancient Silk Road, President Park's main goal was to foster a flow of economic, political, and social interaction from Europe though the Korean Peninsula. Her policy was driven primarily by political and security motives concerning the division of the Peninsula. Park's successor, President Moon announced his own foreign policy initiative, the New Southern Policy (NSP), which seeks to strengthen relations with Southeast Asia while continuing to manage relations with Northeast Asia. While NSP at first sight might suggest a new policy direction, the article argues that both EAI and NSP ultimately have sought to change dynamics on the Korean Peninsula and work toward peace with the North. Both policies reflect the Korean fear of vulnerability to great power competition, seeking to foster relations with smaller powers so as to increase Seoul's foreign policy leverage as a middle power."

Only the Communist Revolution made it possible to emancipate the country from its previous structures. Since then the Chinese economy has followed new trajectories in the area of actual practice and in the ideological and theoretical fields. The first part of the book describes China's present-day trajectories—demographic, agricultural, industrial and commercial. These trajectories reflect the transformation of the country's structural heritage, along with the rise of the forms that succeeded it and opened the way for China's subsequent achievements. The second part deals principally with the new theoretical trajectories that have appeared in China. The focus is on the evolution undergone by the Marxist ideas and theories that led the modernization process as a whole. The author Jean-Claude Delaunay, who was born in 1938, is an honorary professor of French universities who now lives in Nanning, Guangxi Province, China. He has published a dozen books and many articles.

As newly independent Kenya sought foreign aid and trade opportunities, the Sino-Soviet competition for influence in the 'Third World' enabled limited bargaining power for the Kenyan nation, commonly perceived as 'weak'. Through an analysis of the factional political struggles within the Kenya African National Union (KANU) as well as Oginga Odinga's overtures to China, this article emphasises the significance of local dynamics and forces in determining the unfolding 'local' Cold War."
NUCLEAR WEAPONS CLOUD 70 YEARS OF FRIENDSHIP.,SEE-WON BYUN,Comparative Connections: A Triannual E-Journal on East Asian Bilateral Relations,Center for Strategic & International Studies,,,"North Korea conducted five rounds of missile launches in this period as prospects for resuming dialogue with Washington dwindled. Although People's Republic of China State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi praised Pyongyang's diplomatic efforts during his September visit to the North, US-DPRK talks in October made no progress. The nuclear impasse loomed over 70th anniversary celebrations of China-DPRK diplomatic ties, highlighting the expanding friendship Chinese President Xi Jinping and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un envisioned last June. Amid concerns over escalating tensions on the Korean Peninsula, Beijing and Moscow proposed a draft UN resolution in December calling for the partial lifting of sanctions. For their part, Beijing and Seoul advanced their strategic partnership through talks between Xi and South Korean President Moon Jae-in, the China-ROK-Japan summit in December, Wang's visit to Seoul earlier that month, and the resumption of defense talks in October. But Moon's latest China visit drew much domestic criticism for failing to secure Beijing's cooperation on bilateral and regional priorities. Wang's December visit to Seoul, meanwhile, was most remembered for his attacks on US ""unilateralism"" and ""bullying."" US-China trade tensions and public clashes over Hong Kong present new challenges for the China-ROK partnership."

In this study, we examine a case – the Anti-Domestic Violence with Nude Photos Campaign (裸照反家暴活动) – and the response of Chinese online censorship to this campaign. Campaign activists used nude photos to mobilize the public's support. According to the existing theoretical perspectives such as the collective action potential theory, this kind of online campaign with pornographic elements and the potential to mobilize people is very likely to be censored. Counter to this expectation, we found that not all of the original photos were removed. Our finding suggests that the interactive manner in which activists responded to the public on SinaWeibo's discussion threads matters in terms of the degree of censorship. This study complements the existing studies on the Chinese online censorship system, echoes scholars' call for studies on censorship from a more interactive angle, and furthers our understanding of the Chinese feminist movement."

It reveals some economic and social factors that affect crew safety reporting practices and that lead to under-reporting as well as biased reporting. Such factors include, but are not limited to, crew's concerns over their income, future promotion and job insecurity, reputation at work, solidarity among crew, and the fluidity of employment. These elements explicitly or implicitly affect the validity of Occupational Health and Safety indicators. This article's analysis serves as a cautionary reminder for industry employers who adopt indicator-based OHS management systems."
Of Bombs and Bureaucrats: Internal Drivers of Nuclear Force Building in China and the United States.,"Heginbotham, Eric; Heim, Jacob L.; Twomey, Christopher P.",Journal of Contemporary China,Taylor & Francis Ltd,ARMS control; MILITARY service; NATIONAL security; BUREAUCRACY; NUCLEAR forces (Physics); CHINA,,"This article examines the domestic influences on US and Chinese nuclear forces. While strategic factors largely drive each side's, underappreciated domestic and organizational factors also influence outcomes. Partisan politics shape US policies regarding arms control, missile defense, and the roles of nuclear forces. China has its own— more opaque—politics. Organizational factors have affected the status and role of the Chinese Rocket Forces. Constituencies for nuclear weapons have gained ground, and the military services appear to be competing for nuclear missions. The absence of organizational firewalls within the Rocket Forces suggests that assertive operational practices might bleed across different parts of the organization. These domestic influences on US and Chinese nuclear policymaking are likely to have interactive and accelerating effects. Both sides will assume measures taken by the other are driven by strategic intent, when the actual drivers may be mixed. To the extent that domestic factors are responsible, the resulting spirals of suspicion and conflict will be inadvertent—but may nevertheless take on a life of their own. While strategic nuclear interactions are not currently at the center of the bilateral relationship, they may come to be so in the future for all the wrong reasons."

Even if actors are uncertain of each other's preferences, they know what types of actions the other will view as cooperative. Yet on many real‐world issues, cooperation is subjective, and what constitutes a cooperative action is conditional on the receiver's preferences. We present a formal model showing that in these cases, two‐sided incomplete information actually incentivizes honest behavior and facilitates credible signaling. Because uncertain senders do not know whether a particular action will be interpreted as cooperative, they have little incentive to misrepresent, and instead honestly pursue their true goals. Thus, where cooperation is subjective, mutual uncertainty is ""offsetting,"" such that credible signals allow actors to quickly and accurately update their beliefs. We illustrate this logic through a case study of the Sino–Soviet split, and highlight the model's implications for contemporary U.S.–China relations."

This study investigates the effects of oil and natural gas development on violent incidents in Xinjiang, China, using data from its eighty-six counties. Contrary to the resource curse claim, we find that areas with larger quantities of resource production have lower rates of violence. The analysis of reserves data confirms that this finding is not driven by endogeneity between violence and resource production. This soothing effect of resources subsides, however, in areas with high mosque density. While we find no supporting evidence that drastic ethno-demographic changes or strengthening of public security are associated with resource extraction, the analysis shows that resource development contributes to improved local economic conditions, particularly with respect to employment and the incomes of employees of state-owned enterprises."

Using new historical data on Chinese aid in Africa and the case of Ethiopia, we have three main findings. First, China developed a distinct model of mixing ODA-like aid and commercial forms of economic engagement only after the mid-1990s, reflecting institutional reforms for allocating and managing foreign official finance. Second, social sectors have played a much greater role in China's aid programme than is commonly perceived. Finally, Chinese aid to productive sectors has changed substantially whereas in social sectors it is relatively consistent."
"Oligopolistic suppliers, symbiotic value chains and workers' bargaining power: labour contestation in South China at an ascendant global footwear firm.","KUMAR, ASHOK",Global Networks,Wiley-Blackwell,CHINA; YUE Yuen Industrial (Holdings) Ltd.; VALUE chains; SOCIAL reproduction; VALUE capture,BARGAINING POWER; CONSOLIDATION; FOOTWEAR; STRIKE; SYMBIOSIS; WORKERS; YUE YUEN,"In this article, I analyse changes in the power relationship between lead firms, manufacturers and workers by examining a strike that took place in South China in 2014 among workers at the Taiwanese footwear giant, Yue Yuen. In the process, I demonstrate that there is a link between increased labour costs, capital consolidation and greater value capture at the bottom of the global supply chain. I argue that footwear value chains are seeing a falling level of monopsony power and the emergence of enormous oligopolistic suppliers, which are transforming the power imbalances of global supply chains towards a more mutually dependent 'buyer–producer symbiosis'. The Yue Yuen strike shows a maturing industrial working class, facing pressures on social reproduction in China, adapting its bargaining strategies vis‐à‐vis the developmental state. Influxes of profit raise the ceiling for what can be demanded of employers, stimulating those same employers to pursue more aggressive means of holding onto their profits. The example of the Yue Yuen strike is an indicator of what are fundamental changes in the production process, dynamics within the value chain, and power and agency of workers in labour‐intensive production. The strike demonstrates that consolidation is playing a decisive role in shaping the power relationship between domestic manufacturers and transnational brands, which, in turn, is directly affecting the bargaining power of workers."
On Authoritarian Political Representation in Contemporary China.,"Duan, Demin",Politics & Governance,Cogitatio Press,"REPRESENTATIVE government; POLITICAL community; STATE constitutions; CHINA; CHINESE Communist Party; CHINESE history; LINGUISTIC change; DENG, Xiaoping, 1904-1997",authoritarian politics; authority; China; Chinese Communist Party; deliberation; democracy; representation,"Both in the Party Charter and in the State Constitution, the Chinese Communist Party claims to represent the Chinese people. Instead of treating this claim as mere rhetoric made by the party for propaganda purposes, this article demonstrates that it indicates a rather significant transition in the party's understanding of its relationship with the people. Particularly, roughly about two decades into the Open and Reform policy initiated under the leadership of Deng Xiaoping, the party made a strategic choice in imagining itself as the representative of the people instead of the revolutionary vanguard. This change in the language was very remarkable in the post-1949 Chinese history, in the sense that the party no longer considers itself as the facilitator of proletariat revolution, but as the authoritarian representative in the political community. If representation means ""re-presentation"", as in bringing something absent present, this appears to be what the party tries to do. By embodying the nation, the party tries to represent both the rich and the poor, acting as the arbiter of forever present discords and conflicts within the society. Clearly, this representation has nothing to do with what people usually call ""democratic"" representation. But considering that representation and democracy are conceptually rooted in very different sources, exploring ""authoritarian representation"" in contemporary China would enable us to better understand both China and democratic representation."

Based on an analysis of the Chinese journal Guofang Keji, this article investigates how China's strategic community theorises advantage and disadvantage in the cyber domain and how this differs from Western perspectives on cyberwarfare."

While large emerging countries recovered relatively quickly, their performance deteriorated in recent years, despite the modest recovery in advanced economies. The higher divergence of business cycles is closely linked to the Chinese economy. During the crisis, the Chinese fiscal stimulus prevented an abrupt decline in GDP growth not only in that country, but also in resource‐rich economies. Due to lower commodity demand, the environment became more challenging for many emerging markets in recent years. This view is supported by Bayesian structural VARs specified for the individual BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India and China) countries. The results reveal a strong impact of the international economy on GDP growth. However, in contrast to the other countries, China plays a crucial role in determining global trade and oil prices. Therefore, the Chinese economy exerts significant spillovers to the other countries under analysis. The change in the Chinese growth strategy puts additional reform pressure especially in countries with abundant natural resources."

Its economic rise has challenged US ability to fundamentally shape the world trade order. However, the importance of the rise of the Chinese economy for international security affairs is less clear. The key analytical issue for international politics and for an understanding of the sources of power is whether economic power is fungible in international security affairs, whether it can independently determine the strategic alignments of small states. This is also the key question in assessing the implications of China's economic rise for the East Asian security order. The political-economy literature argues that trade dependence can lead small states to realign within great power politics, regardless of the military balance. However, poor case selection challenges this prior literature. By using contemporary East Asia as a source of multiple bilateral case studies, I argue that the economic dependence of a small state on a great economic power is insufficient to influence independently small state strategic alignment preferences and that China's rising economic power is not fungible in East Asian security affairs."

In reality, such protections are limited in practice, with frequent claims by Uyghur activists, human rights NGOs and scholars that government policies result in the religious discrimination of the Uyghur population in Xinjiang. In light of the inefficacy of state legislation in protecting the Uyghurs' religious freedoms, this article considers the protections offered within the Human Rights Treaty System of the United Nations (UN), of which China is both a charter member and an increasingly active participant. However, any attempt to consider Freedom of Religion or Belief protections within the UN's core treaties remains frustrated as China has yet to ratify the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which is the sole UN human rights instrument to contain provisions dedicated to religious and minority rights. To overcome this issue, this article argues that acts of religious discrimination against the Uyghur minority may also fall into contention with the protections contained within the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, a treaty that has been ratified by China and is therefore legally obligated to comply with."

Employing the Chinese Industrial Enterprises Database from 2002 to 2008 to implement the analysis, we find evidence suggesting the presence of tax bias against investments in fixed assets. We address two potential concerns about our analysis and argue that our conclusion is not China‐specific; it is a general lesson for modern finance theory that is portable to developed countries."

However, the alliance elements in China-Russia relations have never been systematically defined and empirically assessed, which makes assessing alliance dynamics in these important bilateral relations difficult. This article develops and applies a set of empirical criteria for an alliance to define how closely the post-Cold War China-Russia military relations have approached the alliance condition. It demonstrates that China and Russia have created strong institutional foundations for an alliance, and now only minor steps are necessary for a formal and functioning military alliance to materialize. However, the occurrence of such steps is not yet guaranteed."

It highlights the major arguments behind the severe criticisms in the West concerning Turkey's negotiations, first with a Chinese firm, and then with a Russian firm, and how this entire process has become a serious bone of contention between Turkey and the U.S., carrying a risk of a spill over into NATO.

The proposed trade routes also include some of the least trade-integrated countries of the world such as Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Bangladesh, Pakistan, as well as more developed economies such as Russia and Europe. Increased infrastructure facilities in these regions will mean better and more integrated links to the world's more developed markets. This study has followed doctrinaire methodology, which includes analytical, descriptive and comparative methods. This study argues that this is not just a regional economic project for enhancing trade and regional economic cooperation but will also have a wider global impact on international trade and economic cooperation. And if the OBOR initiative is successful, then it will accelerate the move from a unipolar post-1991 world to an increasingly multipolar world."

In the context of America's relative decline, we evaluate existing proposals to ease pressure on the United States. We argue that the key aspects of American decline are often operational rather than strategic in nature; consequently that the undifferentiated fashion in which rise and decline is often presented is not useful in describing current changes or in proposing how to address them. Problems at the operational level do not necessarily demand higher-level strategic level alterations. As such, although restructured forms of deep engagement will help alleviate resource constraints in the medium to long term, their utility in addressing the operational changes wrought by relative decline are less apparent. Given that resource constraints are not necessarily the primary concern, therefore, the major strategic elements of American deep engagement are more durable than commonly supposed. America's current strategic objectives are not constrained by changes by virtue of its relative material decline with respect to China but by changes in the operational environment."
"Opportunity cost, income structure, and energy structure for landholders participating in payments for ecosystem services: Evidence from Wolong National Nature Reserve, China.","Sheng, Jichuan; Qiu, Hong; Zhang, Sanfeng",World Development,Elsevier B.V.,LANDOWNERS; WOLONG National Nature Reserve (China); OPPORTUNITY costs; INCOME; PAYMENTS for ecosystem services; FARM production quotas; ECOSYSTEM management; BIODIVERSITY conservation,Energy structure; Grain-to-Green Program; Income structure; Opportunity cost; Payments for ecosystem services; Willingness to participation,"Highlights • Explore the role of opportunity cost, income and energy in PES participation. • Use GTBP's data in WNNR to study the effect of three factors on PES participation. • There is an inverted U-shaped curve between opportunity cost and PES participation. • The dependence on cropland income is inversely proportional to PES participation. • Fuelwood-based energy structure has an adverse effect on PES participation. Abstract Payments for ecosystem services (PES) have become a valuable policy tool for the conservation and restoration of ecosystems. The central premise of PES success is that landholders are willing to provide ecosystem services. However, previous studies failed to consider this willingness of landholders to participate in PES within the theoretical frameworks of opportunity cost, income structure, and energy structure. This lack results in the deviation of the existing PES project design from market-based incentives and gravitation toward adopting command-and-control subsidies that are typically intended to be replaced. To fill this gap, this study examines the effects of opportunity cost, income structure, and energy structure on the participation of landholders in PES, using the panel data of the household survey of the Grain-to-Green Program in the Wolong National Nature Reserve, China. The obtained findings demonstrate an inverted U-shaped curve relationship between opportunity cost and landholder participation rate, suggesting that the participation of landholders in PES does not always decrease with increasing opportunity cost. The dependence of landholders on cropland income is inversely proportional to their participation in PES. The effects of other agricultural income on the decision-making of householders were not significant. Moreover, the fuelwood-based energy structure negatively affects the participation of landholders in PES. Therefore, we argue that the formulation of PES incentives in line with local socioeconomic conditions and individual preferences can further stimulate the landholder participation in PES."

Existing scholarship has often viewed such suitcase trade as locally embedded activities characterised by informality. This article contends that this perception underestimates the diversity and complexity of suitcase trade. This is illustrated with a case study of the Pearl River Delta region of southern China, where thousands of suitcase traders carry goods across the borders between mainland China and its two Special Administrative Regions of Hong Kong and Macao. Several patterns of operation run in parallel, ranging from petty traders working alone to highly-organised group operators. While each individual transaction is small scale and based on informal networks, the entire chain of operations is run by syndicates that are highly organised, commercial, with well-defined divisions of labour, and on a large scale. We describe such a combination of organisational competence and informal networks as ""organised informality."" The concept allows us to expand the analytical horizon to cover those cross-border exchanges that incorporate modern commercial practices in otherwise non-formal settings. It also bridges the oft-criticised dichotomies of formal-informal and licit-illicit."
"ORIGINS OF A ""RAGGED EDGE"": U.S. Ambiguity on the Senkakus' Sovereignty.","Watts IV, Robert C.",Naval War College Review,Naval War College,WORLD War II; SOVEREIGNTY; WAR; AIR defenses; AIR traffic,,The article focuses on complex history leading to the reversion of these islands from American control following World War II to the Japanese in 1972. It mentions the U.S. may have a special responsibility for ensuring that the unresolved issue of the sovereignty of the Senkakus does not escalate to armed conflict. It also mentions China attempted to regulate air traffic in the East China Sea by declaring an air-defense identification zone (ADIZ) that encompassed the Senkakus.
Othering as soft-power discursive practice: China Daily's construction of Trump's America in the 2016 presidential election.,"Pan, Chengxin; Isakhan, Benjamin; Nwokora, Zim",Politics,Sage Publications Inc.,"PRESIDENTIAL elections; MASS media; UNITED States; DISCURSIVE practices; WORKING class whites; CRITICAL discourse analysis; POWER transmission; TRUMP, Donald, 1946-",China; Donald Trump; media discourse; Othering; soft power; the United States,"The relationship between Chinese soft power and Chinese media has been a focus of a growing body of literature. Challenging a resource-based conception of soft power and a transmission view of communication that inform much of the debate, this article adopts a discursive approach to soft power and media communication. It argues that their relationship is not just a matter of resource transmission, but one of discursive construction, which begs the questions of what mediated discursive practices are at play in soft power construction and how. Addressing these oft-neglected questions, we identify a typology of three soft-power discursive practices: charm offensive, Othering offensive, and defensive denial. Focusing on the little-understood practice of Othering offensive, we illustrate its presence in Chinese media through a critical discourse analysis of China Daily 's framing of Donald Trump and the United States, and argue that the Othering offensive in Chinese media that portrays Trump's America as a dysfunctional and declining Other serves to construct a Chinese self as more responsible, dynamic, and attractive. Adding a missing discursive dimension to the study of soft power and the media, this study has both scholarly and practical implications for analysing a nation's soft power strategy."

Overcoming the poverty of Western historical imagination: Alternative analogies for making sense of the South China Sea conflict.,"Kopper, Akos; Peragovics, Tamas",European Journal of International Relations,"Sage Publications, Ltd.",POVERTY reduction; INTERNATIONAL relations; HISTORICAL analysis; DIPLOMACY; SOUTH China Sea,Border conflict; China threat; determinism; historical analogy; South China Sea; Western-centrism,"This article analyzes the use of historical analogies to interpret and explain foreign policy behavior, focusing on the South China Sea conflict. In reviewing coverage in the international English-language press, we find a range of historical analogies, from the conflict between Athens and Sparta to the 1938 Munich agreement, to interpret China's strategy and motivations in the region. While analogies are powerful tools for interpreting international events, their use has dangers as they are often deployed to justify decisions rather than analyze options. This article has two goals. First, we argue that relying excessively on Western analogies for understanding China can be misleading; instead, we suggest visiting examples from China's past that offer alternative readings of its current ambitions. Second, we suggest a way to overcome the deterministic application of historical analogies by not taking them individually, but rather taking them as sets of alternative scenarios. This way, they can provide important insights for generating critical debate and informing tactful diplomacy."
Overlapping regionalism and cooperative hegemony: how China and India compete in South and Southeast Asia.,"Rüland, Jürgen; Michael, Arndt",Cambridge Review of International Affairs,Taylor & Francis Ltd,"REGIONALISM (International organization); HEGEMONY; SOUTHEAST Asia; CHINA-India relations; GEOGRAPHICAL perception; PEDERSEN, Thomas",,"This article examines the phenomenon of overlapping regionalism in South and Southeast Asia. Theoretically it rests on Thomas Pedersen's 'ideational-institutionalist realism' approach. We argue that in the two sub-regions under study the proliferation of regional organizations has been greatly stimulated by hegemonic and counter-hegemonic dynamics involving Asia's largest powers, China and India. We claim that sceptical world views highlighting vulnerability, victimization and national survival are deeply entrenched in the mental maps of the regions' foreign policy elites. Regional institution building is thus informed by the tenets of realism. We trace how and why China and India seek to establish 'cooperative hegemonies' by building regional institutions for incorporating their neighbours into their sphere of influence while keeping rival powers at bay, and also show why smaller states in the region join these regional fora."

The BRI will drive China's ports to expand connectivity through construction and operation along the '21st-Century Maritime Silk Road (MSR)'. At the same time, port governance involves central, provincial and local governments engaging in overseas investment and financing in the context of the BRI. Under the double-level governance of the central and local governments, discrepancies, disjointed actions and gaps inevitably arise between the policies launched by the central and local governments. This article evaluates 14 major coastal ports operating with state-level support and overseas investment. 11 evaluation indexes are determined from the existing development conditions of ports and the economic strength of port cities. Fuzzy clustering method is applied to evaluate and classify the development of the coastal ports in China and to develop a reasonable implementation mode of the 'going global strategy' of the ports. Consequently, it would help policymakers and stakeholders in China deal with the rivalry of provincial governments, alleviate overseas investment risks and strengthen the foreign port chain management along the MSR."
Pakistan's Journey into Space.,"Ahsan, Ali; Khan, Ahmad",Astropolitics,Taylor & Francis Ltd,NATURAL resources; PUBLIC-private sector cooperation; PAKISTAN; INDIA; CHINA; DEVELOPING countries; SPACE industrialization; SPACE,,"Despite political, technological, and economic constraints, Pakistan is considered an aspiring space power with a relatively modest space program compared to the larger, more successful ones of China and India. Innovative leadership, smart allocation of national resources, and political will are all necessary for any country to progress in such a high-technology field. The Chinese and Indian space programs pose unique challenges and opportunities for Pakistan. Rivalry with India over its regional and extra-regional ambitions means that Pakistan would have to give serious thought towards bolstering its space program as part of its national outlook in the twenty-first century. Pakistan can utilize cordial relations with China to improve its nascent space infrastructure through collaborative efforts to gain eventual self-sufficiency for socioeconomic and strategic purposes in the South Asian region. While Pakistan may not have the economic clout of a bigger power, it can utilize the ""Space 2.0"" concept of multilateral and public-private partnerships to empower its space program, enhance its domestic scientific and technological base, and build an indigenous space industry that can reap dividends at home and abroad. This can also benefit Pakistan's needs to maintain strategic parity with India and stake its own claims as an emerging space nation."

However, the parent–child metaphor is no longer shared by the new generation in Hong Kong. The change of the sociopolitical environment in Hong Kong in the Post-Umbrella Movement demands a new social imaginary for understanding ""one country, two systems."" This paper argues that the metaphor of reconciliation proposed by the churches and supported by the Hong Kong government fails to respond to the experience of the Hong Kongese, recommending instead a metaphor of center-edge in dialogue with insights from liberation theologies. In terms of geography, politics, and culture, living on the edge helps the Hong Kongese to articulate their experience in a situation of decreasing protection of human rights in Hong Kong."
Parsing the Effect of the Internet on Regime Support in China.,"Tang, Min; Huhe, Narisong",Government & Opposition,Cambridge University Press,INTERNET & politics; CHINA; INTERNET & society,government censorship; internet; mediation analysis; performance evaluation; political support,"Although the internet is severely censored in China, negative reporting and critical deliberations of political institutions and policy issues, especially low-profile ones, have been abundant in cyberspace. Given such a mixed pattern of online information, this study explores the complexity of the effect of the internet on regime support by parsing it into direct effect and indirect effect. It argues that the internet indirectly erodes its viewers' overall support for the authoritarian regime by decreasing their evaluation of government performance. The findings from a mediation analysis of a Beijing sample support this argument. The result of one analysis also indicates that the direct effect of internet use on regime support can be positive. Such findings about the effect of the internet in China help advance our understanding of both political and theoretical implications of the spread of the internet in authoritarian countries."
"Partner Politics: Russia, China, and the Challenge of Extending US Hegemony after the Cold War.","Mastanduno, Michael",Security Studies,Taylor & Francis Ltd,"COLD War, 1945-1991; HEGEMONY; AUTHORITY; PRACTICAL politics; RUSSIA; CHINA",,"Hegemonic-order theory draws attention to relationships of asymmetrical power and legitimate consent. This article emphasizes the importance of ""lynchpin partnerships"" in the maintenance of hegemonic order. The postwar US order relied on partnerships with Germany and Japan, and after the Cold War the United States sought to enlarge its hegemony by offering partner bargains to Russia and China. The terms of partnership differed significantly based on the relative significance of each state to the management of America's hegemonic order. That order is now in jeopardy given that the partnership with Russia failed, while that with China succeeded for two decades but is now under considerable strain. The US experience suggests that hegemonic orders are easier to establish than to extend, and, since the dominant state controls the terms of entry, liberal hegemonic orders are easier for some states to join than for others."
Past Successes and Future Challenges in Rural China's Human Capital.,"Bai, Yu; Zhang, Siqi; Wang, Lei; Dang, Ruirui; Abbey, Cody; Rozelle, Scott",Journal of Contemporary China,Taylor & Francis Ltd,"HUMAN capital; CHINA; EDUCATION -- China; ECONOMIC conditions in China, 2000-; RURAL youth; VOCATIONAL schools; STUDENTS",,"This paper describes the current level of human capital in China and seeks to identify a number of education-related challenges that may slow down the nation's economy from transitioning to high-income status. Relying on recent census-based data from OECD for the rest of the world and using data from the 2015 Micro-Census for China, the authors show that the low levels of education of China's labour force is really a problem that has its roots in the past (in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s). In recent years (since 2000), China has been investing heavily in education as shown by the increasing the share of youth, including rural youth, attending high school. Despite this recent effort to raise the nation's human capital, the education system still faces several challenges in trying to provide high-quality education for all youth. First, the government must figure out a way to overcome the relatively low rates of participation in high school by rural students. Second, there is concern that many vocational schools, especially those in rural areas, cannot deliver quality education. Finally, the paper will show that many rural students may be unprepared due to poor early childhood development outcomes."

Although the Jesuits did not invent this association, which was rooted in Greco-Roman historiography, the Jesuit encyclopaedist Antonio Possevino (1533-1611) was the first to link the 'perpetual peace' (perpetua pax) and 'supreme concord' (summa concordia) of the Chinese state to the Confucian intellectual tradition. As the Jesuits' missionary strategy developed under the tutelage of Matteo Ricci (1552-1610), 'public peace' (pax publica) and 'the calm of the Republic' (Republica quies) came to be perceived as the ultimate purpose of the Confucian precepts and one of the hinges on which the aims of Christianity, Confucianism and natural law can be reconciled. The supreme expression of the link between Confucianism and peace can be found in the Confucius Sinarum philosophus (1687), which presented for the first time an accessible translation of three of the four Confucian classics. Yet while retaining the view that pre-Qin Confucianism espoused peace as a central political aim, the Confucius Sinarum philosophus challenged the view that contemporary China could be regarded as a utopic actualization of Confucian peace. This paper will discuss this shift as an attempt to coopt the Chinese political experience as an argument against the pragmatic political philosophy known as 'reason of state', which was perceived by Jesuit thinkers as atheistic and immoral."

Unlike previous studies' findings that most Asians hold positive views of China's influence, this study finds that Asian youth view a rising China more coolly than does the general public. Even though they acknowledge that China's rise offers increased opportunities, Asian youth tend to strongly distrust and worry about the negative influence of China. The results show that most youth in Asian countries surveyed believe China's rise will challenge global order and that China will not maintain peaceful relations with other Asian countries. Multilevel analyses show that both microlevel personal traits and macrolevel structural factors can account for how Asian youth view China's rise. The results indicate that China has not successfully convinced young Asian citizens of its determination to rise peacefully. China's foreign policymaking should take greater consideration of Asian public opinion rather than be dominated by wishful thinking."

This article examines a new form of peasant resistance nested in interactions between peasants and a non-governmental organization (NGO). Through the lens of a post-earthquake reconstruction programme in which peasants cannot be simply regarded as subordinates or a powerless group, it offers an alternative view on theories of 'rightful resistance' and 'everyday forms of resistance'. With rural relations become more complex, the authors argue that contextually sensitive analyses which include multilateral interactions are needed for more in-depth understanding of diverse peasant resistance in contemporary China."

'Perceived social citizenship': a comparative study between two different hukous.,"Jensen, Birgitte",Citizenship Studies,Taylor & Francis Ltd,CITIZENSHIP -- Social aspects; SOCIAL policy; SOCIAL security; RURAL-urban differences; COMPARATIVE studies; CHINA; SOCIAL isolation,capabilities development; China; hukou; Social citizenship; social exclusion; social policy,"In China, there are immense barriers to inclusive social citizenship because of the failure to overcome the institutional fragmentation of social security across the hukou division. The hukou system continues to be important in determining how social citizenship is granted in China; not only does it facilitate dual social citizenship, it imposes perceptions of deservingness that bolster these divisions. The aim of this paper is to build a social-citizenship-based framework, drawing upon the strengths of the capability approach, which is applicable to the complexity of the rural-urban divide in China. Referring to several data sources, the paper examines social citizenship as a subjective phenomenon. The paper highlights the social exclusion mechanisms embedded in the hukou system that might have an effect on social citizenship as a state of self-awareness."
Performing Authoritarian Citizenship: Public Transcripts in China.,"Distelhorst, Greg; Fu, Diana",Perspectives on Politics,Cambridge University Press,CITIZENSHIP; AUTHORITARIANISM; LOCAL government -- Public relations,,"How should we study citizenship in authoritarian regimes? We propose studying how citizenship is performed using the ""public transcript""—communication between ordinary citizens and political authorities. The stakes of these strategic communications allow us to observe the roles citizens play to elicit assistance from authoritarian elites. We use this technique to study citizenship in contemporary China, analyzing evidence from an original database of over eight thousand appeals to local officials. These public transcripts reveal three ideal-type scripts of citizenship. First, we observe individuals performing subjecthood, positioning themselves as subalterns before benevolent rulers. We also identify an authoritarian legal citizenship that appeals to the formal legal commitments of the state. Finally, we find evidence for a socialist citizenship which appeals to the moral duties of officials to provide collective welfare. This approach eschews a classification scheme based on regime types, instead acknowledging that diverse performances of citizenship can coexist within a single state."
Personal values and value congruence of public administration graduate students: An exploratory study in China.,"Zhong, Wei; Bao, Yuanjie",Australian Journal of Public Administration,Wiley-Blackwell,PUBLIC administration -- Study & teaching; PUBLIC service employment; VALUE congruence; MULTIVARIATE analysis; STUDENT surveys; GRADUATE students; STUDENTS -- China; ANALYSIS of covariance,graduate students; personal values; public administration; public organisation employees; value congruence,"Explorations on the value profiles of current and prospective public organisation employees in China are scarce. The current study investigates this critical issue. Data were collected via a questionnaire from graduate students enrolled in a school of public administration in China. The sample consisted of both full‐time students who were prepared to pursue their careers in public organisations upon graduation, and part‐time students who were mostly public organisation employees. Multivariate analyses of covariance (MANCOVAs) and analyses of covariance (ANCOVAs) were used for data analysis. The results show that there are consistent value preferences among all students, and some noteworthy patterns in the relationship between value profiles and demographic and work‐related features. The results also shed light on whether a unique value set could differentiate various types of organisations, and demonstrate that employees in the core public service perceive higher level of value congruence than those in parapublic sectors. These findings provide implications and insights for the management practices in public organisations. Ongoing institutional reform and organizational change in China may reshape the personal values of current and prospective public organization employees. Drawing from extant public value research, this survey study examines Chinese MPA students' value preferences and congruence to provide a delineated picture to facilitate the personnel management of public organizations."

The article traces the rise of the RMB in international oil trade in recent years and provides an analysis of its impact on the internationalization of the Chinese currency. We argue that despite the increasing use of the yuan in oil trade in recent years, in the short term it is highly unlikely that a petro-RMB system will emerge to rival the petrodollar system. Unlike the petrodollar, which combines the qualities of a master currency, a top currency and a negotiated currency, China lacks the economic leadership and the political and geopolitical leverages to make the RMB a major petrocurrency. Although the emergence of the RMB-denominated Shanghai oil futures is an important development, the absence of highly developed financial markets and a strong legal system in China hinders its potential. In the long run, the RMB may take on a more prominent role in the international oil trade as China's weight as an oil importer rises. More importantly, the overuse of financial sanctions by the US government has begun to undermine the role of the dollar within and beyond the oil trade. In addition, the rise of alternative energy sources will diminish the centrality of oil in the world economy, thus reducing the significance of petrocurrencies—whether the dollar or the RMB—in shaping the international currency system."
Phantom Services: Deflecting Migrant Workers in China.,"Chan, Alexsia T.; O'Brien, Kevin J.",China Journal,University of Chicago Press,URBAN planning; IMMIGRANTS; MUNICIPAL services; CITIZENSHIP; CHINA; MEDICAL care,,"As China urbanizes, more migrants need and expect public services. Many municipalities, however, resist and undermine elements of the central government's urbanization strategy by deflecting demands for benefits instead of meeting them or denying them outright. Urban authorities sometimes do so by establishing nearly impossible eligibility requirements or requiring paperwork that outsiders struggle to obtain. At times they also nudge migrants to seek health care or education elsewhere by enforcing dormant rules or by shutting down a locally available service provider. Local officials use these ploys for both political and practical reasons. Limiting access isolates and disempowers migrants and is cheaper than offering benefits. Phantom services are a consequence of the localization of the household registration system (hukou 户口) and a sign that new axes of inequality and gradations of second-class citizenship have emerged."

Instead of asserting its de jure sovereign rights, which were reaffirmed by the PCA's decision, Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte instead opted to build stronger relations with China. Proposing a burden sharing analytical approach, the article argues that the Philippines is using China as leverage in its alliance with the United States. By exploiting the ""China Card"" and downplaying the arbitration case, the Philippines has extracted concessions from Beijing and Washington. In capitalizing on the Sino‐American rivalry, Manila has reaffirmed its strategic value within the U.S.‒Philippines alliance while benefitting more visibly from Chinese foreign aid and investment pledges. However, the Philippines' policy posture vis‐à‐vis China reflects short‐term diplomatic and economic tactics rather than an enduring strategic reorientation away from the United States."
PLA Reforms as Seen from the Composition of the Central Military Commission of the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China.,Ying Yu Lin,Korean Journal of Defense Analysis,Korea Institute for Defense Analyses,,19th National Congress of CPC; Central Military Commission; joint operation; PLA study,"Following the most recent round of military reforms launched in 2016, the People's Liberation Army (PLA), from the highest to the lowest echelons, has been moving in the direction dictated by President Xi Jinping. The major concern of the PLA, however, is the membership of the Central Military Commission (CMC). The list of candidates for the CMC of the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC) was not decided until the first plenary session of the Central Committee of the CPC after the 19th National Congress. The CMC retains its one chairman and two vice chairmen leadership structure, but only the chiefs of the Joint Staff Department and Political Work Department, the Minister of National Defense and the head of the Commission for Discipline Inspection are granted a seat in the CMC. As compared with the 18th CMC, the 19th CMC has fewer members. The decrease in the number of CMC members represents a change in the command structure of the PLA. From a hierarchical perspective, each level of command has its political and professional significance, also tasked with different missions. All levels work together to manage the PLA, the world's largest military force. From the change in the composition of the CMC, the selection of candidates for CMC membership, the qualifications of the candidates in terms of grade and rank, and their functions, this study seeks to find out the impact of the 19th CMC members and newly-appointed theater commands' and the services' commanding generals and admirals on the PLA reforms as well as the implications thereof."
Playing by the Informal Rules: Why the Chinese Regime Remains Stable Despite Rising Protests.,"LaFortune, Gabrielle",Asian Politics & Policy,Wiley-Blackwell,CONFLICT management; RELIEF valves; CHINESE,,"In regime-threatening protests, protestors deny state legitimacy and state actors frequently respond with force. The chapter also illustrates how regime-engaging protests can become regime-threatening, and how the latter call into question regime legitimacy both domestically and internationally. This is not to take away from the author's overall argument: she convincingly argues that regime-engaging protests are the most frequently occurring, and that these allow China to remain stable by creating cooperation between protesters and state actors, as well as by channeling grievances into formal structures for conflict resolution."
Playing it safe: toy safety and conformity assessment in Europe and the United States.,"Larson, Derek B.; Jordan, Sara R.",International Review of Administrative Sciences,"Sage Publications, Ltd.",PRODUCT safety; CONSUMER protection; INTERNATIONAL Organization for Standardization,consumer safety; global governance; regulation; responsiveness,"Do similar standards of product safety lead to similar levels of consumer safety? In 2007, more than 19 million toys worldwide were recalled for violations of applicable safety standards. Following these recalls, both the EU and the US instituted new policies governing children's products: the US Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008 (CPSIA) and EU 2009 Toy Safety Directive. The relevant toy safety standards that emerged from this legislation, such as ISO (ISO 8124), US (ASTM F963), and EU (EN 71) standards are comparable in terms of their language but not their results. Using a data set profiling implementation of EU and US conformity assessment systems for determination of product safety for toys manufactured in China, we find that weighted recall totals for violative products are between 10 and 20 times higher in the EU than the US. This suggests that differences in the implementation of global standards result in more unsafe products initially reaching consumers in some locations. Points for practitioners: Government officials should avoid assuming that safety begins and ends with international standards. The process for verifying that products meet established standards is as important as the standards themselves, and it can have significant economic and safety impacts The choice of conformity assessment system for a given product or market is driven by many considerations, including appetite for risk, political institutions and practice, and variations in national-level administrative capacity. Discussions on the merits of any conformity assessment system for a given market, or product, should incorporate all of these factors."
Polarized China: The Effect of Media Censorship on People's Ideology.,Gaoming Zhu,Critique: A Worldwide Student Journal of Politics,"Illinois State University, Department of Politics & Government",MASS media; IDEOLOGY; MASS media policy; CULTURAL nationalism; INTERNET censorship; CENSORSHIP; CHINA; MEDIA consumption,,"Ideological polarization is not a unique product of western politics. A national survey (2007-2014)1 revealed that the overarching division in Chinese society is split between nationalism and cultural liberalism. Why does polarization happen in society where state ideology dominates the political apparatuses? This paper approaches this puzzle by examining the relationship between individuals' media diet facilitated by media censorship policies and their ideology in China. The findings suggest that polarization as an outcome is caused by nationalists adhering to heavily state-controlled media, while liberals seek less censored resources. The findings also suggest that polarization as a process is due to the fact that agnostics who use the media mainly for learning purposes tend to stay or become nationalists, while agnostics who use media mainly for entertainment purposes tend to become liberals."
Policies and Counterstrategies: State-Sponsored Filiality and False Accusation in Qing China.,"Du, Yue",International Journal of Asian Studies,Cambridge University Press,,agency; false accusation; filial piety; imperial governance; Qing law,"Using court cases culled from various national and local archives in China, this article examines two strategies widely employed by Qing litigants to manipulate state-sponsored filiality to advance their perceived interests in court: ""instrumental filicide to lodge a false accusation"" and ""false accusation of unfiliality."" While Qing subjects were willing and able to exploit the legalized inequality between parent and child for profit-seeking purposes, the Qing imperial state tolerated such maneuvering so as to co-opt local negotiations to reinforce orthodox notions of the parent–child hierarchy in its subjects' everyday lives. Local actors, who appealed to the Qing legal promotion of parental dominance and filial obedience to empower themselves, were recruited into the Qing state's project of moral penetration and social control, with law functioning as a conduit and instrument that gave the design of ""ruling the empire through the principle of filial piety"" a concrete legal form in imperial governance."
Policies for Recruiting Talented Professionals from the Diaspora: India and China Compared.,"Li, Wei; Bakshi, Kanika; Tan, Yining; Huang, Xuanyu",International Migration,Wiley-Blackwell,FOREIGN workers; RETURN migration; IMMIGRATION policy; EMIGRATION & immigration -- Economic aspects; SKILLED labor recruitment,,"Despite the continuous asymmetrical power relations between the Global North and South, the ""global race for talent"" is no longer a privilege enjoyed only by developed countries. Comparative analysis of policy content and effectiveness has attracted increasing interest. The examination of policy initiatives resulting in return migration of highly‐skilled migrants from the Global North to the Global South, however, remains inadequate. In this article, we provide a comparative analysis of policies targeting high‐level Chinese and Indian professionals including full‐time returnees. Two key differences in policy instruments and outcomes in the two countries are identified and they have implications for migration policies in other countries in the Global South and North."
Political Changes in China Since the 19th CCP Congress: Xi Jinping Is Not Weaker But More Contested.,"Cabestan, Jean-Pierre",East Asia: An International Quarterly,Springer Nature,"CHINESE Communist Party; CHINA -- Politics & government; CHINA-United States relations; POLITICAL party leadership; XI, Jinping, 1953-",Chinese Communist Party; Economic reforms; Li Keqiang; State council; Trade war; Xi Jinping,"Since the 19th Congress of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), Xi Jinping has continued to dominate the political stage. Having succeeded to abolish the two-term limit for the presidency in March 2018, he has consolidated even more his power, restructuring several Party and state agencies and promoting many supporters to key positions. He has also privileged very conservative policies, raising questions about China's reform and open-door strategy. However, in the summer of 2018, in the context of a growing trade war with the US, his opponents have launched an offensive that has highlighted deepening divisions within the Party leadership and among the elites. While today Xi is more contested than before, his detractors have remained unable to weaken him, let alone to use the trade war with the US, to force him to radically change course."
Political Context and Citizen Information: Propaganda Effects in China.,"Chen, Dan",International Journal of Public Opinion Research,Oxford University Press / USA,PROPAGANDA; CHINA; INTERNET users; COMPUTER surveys,,"Propaganda is integral to authoritarian rule. Yet, questions remain regarding what propaganda content is effective at influencing which opinions and to whom. Using an original online survey experiment conducted in China, this study finds that although propaganda is ineffective with average Internet users, it persuades highly informed participants when reality validates its messages. The propaganda treatments enhance opinions on government performance in several issue areas, including anticorruption and the economy, for participants who are politically informed. Propaganda thus sways opinions when real-world changes lend support, which necessitates a certain level of acquired information. These results suggest the limits of propaganda while specifying conditions for its effects."
POLITICAL DEVELOPMENT OF KAZAKHSTAN: RESULTS AND PROSPECTS.,"ZHILTSOV, Sergey; ZONN, Igor",Central Asia & the Caucasus (14046091),CA & CC Press AB,POLITICAL development; PRESIDENTIAL elections; HEADS of state; POLITICAL elites; POLITICAL systems; KAZAKHSTAN; SHOCK response,Kazakhstan; Nazarbayev; political process; political system; power; Tokayev,"Kazakhstan has been following its own path of social development that differed a lot from its Central Asian neighbors: it did not opt for total democratization as Kyrgyzstan did (viewed at a certain time as the region's most democratic country) and was not tempted by the autocratic trends typical of Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan where, back in 1992, the president became the central figure with the parliament and the judicial system pushed aside. Kazakhstan took time to build up its political system, where the president invariably remained the main figure. The First President of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev played a huge role in the political processes unfolding in the country and its development as a whole. His well-balanced foreign policy helped avoid the shocks of economic reforms and political upheavals inside and outside the country and establish good relationships with its Central Asian neighbors as well as with Russia, the U.S., and China. For a long time the First President was consistently consolidating the executive power vertical in order to concentrate it in the hands of the president and stabilize the social and economic situation by keeping the multifaceted influence of regional elites in check. On the other hand, consolidation of presidential power caused certain political problems, which negatively affected the country's development, namely, lack of political elite rotation and complete domination of the president in the country where the parliament had no independent role to play. The political system, therefore, was adjusted to the interests of Nazarbayev and his closest circle, which became especially clear when he decided that time had come to start looking for ways and means to preserve political stability and remain in control. It was vitally important to continue his wellbalanced foreign policy, to prevent cardinal changes in the balance of power inside the country and ensure the continuity of power. On the other hand, changes at the country's highest post could no longer be postponed, which explains why in recent years the First President of Kazakhstan has been working hard to resolve the problem. In 2019, Kassym-Jomart Tokayev won the off-year presidential elections to become the second president of Kazakhstan. The process attracted a lot of attention for the simple reason that the head of state is the key figure in the country's political system. The fact that Nursultan Nazarbayev stayed away from the elections for the first time in the country's history and suggested Tokayev as a presidential candidate stirred even more interest. This election summed up the presidency of Nazarbayev, who remained the key figure on the republic's political arena. Tokayev's advent to power opened a new stage for the country's political development, the results of which are hardly predictable."
Political incentives in firms' financial reporting: evidence from the crackdown on corrupt municipal officials.,"Wang, Xiuhua; Gu, Xi",Economics of Governance,Springer Nature,FINANCIAL disclosure; LABOR incentives; CHINA; FINANCIAL statements; INSTITUTIONAL investors; MONETARY incentives; BAD news; BUSINESS enterprises,Anti-corruption campaign; Financial reporting; Political incentive; Withholding good news,"This paper examines political incentives in firms' financial reporting during the anti-corruption campaign in China. We find robust evidence that the turnover of municipal officials due to the prosecution of corruption causes affiliated firms to strategically withhold good news relative to bad news. This effect is more pronounced among state-owned firms and firms located in highly corrupt places, while it is depressed among firms with the big-four auditing firms and among firms with Qualified Foreign Institutional Investors. Further tests show that this effect is temporary. We find affiliated firms release minor bad news on time and withhold minor good news during the turnover of corrupt municipal officials. Overall, our study provides novel evidence that firms have political incentives in financial reporting regarding the release of good and bad news, and the anti-corruption campaign in China can act as a governance mechanism to temporarily improve the financial reporting environment."

It demonstrates that the governance of solar energy in China operates on two levels, with 'police patrol' control and monitoring mechanisms at the meso- or sectoral level combined with 'fire alarm' modes of political control at the micro-level. Drawing on original interview material, we argue that this two-level model and distinct set of supervisory institutions have allowed China, as a relatively late entrant into the solar energy sector, to address the growing environmental emergency within China and catch up technologically with the West."
Political representation of racial minorities in the parliament of Singapore.,"Tam, Waikeung",Japanese Journal of Political Science,Cambridge University Press,RACIAL minorities; REPRESENTATIVE government; LEGISLATIVE bodies; POLITICAL parties; LEGISLATORS; SINGAPORE; AUTOMOBILE seats; SEATING (Furniture),Legislator behavior; parliamentary questions; political representation; racial minorities; Singapore's parliamentary politics,"This research note studies the political representation of racial minorities in Singapore. Specifically, it analyzes whether racial minority members of parliament (MPs) are more likely than Chinese MPs to represent the interests of racial minorities in the Parliament. I answer this question through conducting content analyses of the parliamentary questions raised during the plenary meetings of the 10th–12th Parliament of Singapore (2002–2015). In total, 6,678 questions were asked. Our results show that racial minority MPs were significantly more likely (21.79 times) than Chinese MPs to ask questions related to racial minorities. While this study shows that racial minority MPs were significantly more likely than Chinese MPs to ask questions related to racial minorities, it also highlights the inadequacy of representation of racial minority interests in the Parliament of Singapore. During our period of study, only 1.2% of the total number of parliamentary questions focused on racial minorities. Besides MPs' race, this study finds that partisan affiliation crucially influenced the likelihood of MPs to represent racial minority interests. Political parties played an important role in shaping MPs' representational behavior. Compared to the People's Action Party (PAP) MPs, opposition MPs were significantly more likely to raise racial minority-related questions. One possible explanation could be that opposition MPs used parliamentary questions as an important tool to challenge and criticize the governing party's policies on racial minorities. Another explanation could be that PAP racial minority MPs' first loyalty has to be to the party and government rather than their co-ethnics, given that they are beholden to party elites for their seats."
Political Turnover and Chinese Development Cooperation.,"Professor, Matthew DiLorenzo Assistant; AidData, Mengfan Cheng",Chinese Journal of International Politics,Oxford University Press / USA,"LEADERSHIP; COALITIONS; CHINA; UNITED States; DUTERTE, Rodrigo, 1945-",,"Some view recent, high-profile Chinese aid and investment agreements that have followed changes in the leadership of recipient states as evidence of China's intent to compete for political influence in countries that are traditionally close to the United States and its allies. We examine how patterns of China's development investment vary with changes of domestic leadership in potential recipient states, and argue that domestic coalition turnover may plausibly create uncertainty as to whether recipient countries will shift political allegiance towards or away from Chinese influence. If China indeed views development finance as a tool to acquire or maintain influence in developing countries, the timing of coalition changes in such countries should coincide with increases in China's development commitments. We use AidData's Global Chinese Official Finance Dataset and an extended version of the Change in Source of Leader Support (CHISOLS) Dataset of domestic coalition changes to evaluate the relationship between Chinese finance and leader turnover in non-OECD countries throughout the period 2000–2014. Our analysis provides some statistical evidence that political turnover influences the allocation of more concessional, ODA-like finance from China. We also find evidence that the relationship between domestic coalition changes and Chinese financial flows varies according to the recipient's alliance status with the United States and regime type."
Politics in Malaysia Today-Demise of the Hybrid? Not So Fast.,"Case, William",Taiwan Journal of Democracy,Taiwan Foundation for Democracy,LIBERTY; PRACTICAL politics; ETHNIC groups; ELECTIONS; MALAYSIA; CHINESE,Authoritarian durability; democratic change; elections; elite cohesion; hybrid regimes; Malaysia; punishment regime,"Malaysia long operated a hybrid political regime, demarcated by limited civil liberties and calibrated electoral competitiveness. Further, while this regime's asymmetric institutions gained intrinsic resilience, they found grounding in Malaysia's divided and ranked society, pitting a politically favored community of ""indigenous"" Malays against peripheral ""non-Malays,"" mostly ethnic Chinese. In this milieu, a ruling coalition persisted in power, the Barisan Nasional (National Front), centered by the United Malays National Organization (UMNO). The country's variant of hybrid politics thus articulated as a durable single-party dominant system. However, after forty-four years of incumbency, Barisan was defeated in an election by a rival coalition, Pakatan Harapan (Alliance of Hope). Even so, this study shows that during Pakatan's first year in power, democratic change has been inhibited by a complex set of factors. They include the stifling legacies of hybrid politics, their resonance with insistent communal privileging, and the winning opposition's frailties in office. Thus, while Malaysia is no longer a single-party dominant system, its politics persist within a resilient hybrid category."
Politics of Anticorruption in China: Paradigm Change of the Party's Disciplinary Regime 2012-2017.,"Li, Ling",Journal of Contemporary China,Taylor & Francis Ltd,"LEADERSHIP; DIPLOMACY; DEPOLITICIZATION; ALLEGIANCE; POLITICAL corruption; XI, Jinping, 1953-",,"This article traces the process of Xi Jinping's campaign in 2012-2017 and explains how an anticorruption effort has been transformed into an exercise of power-consolidation for his office. The findings of this article are three-fold. First, the power-consolidation process has benefited from a combination of an ideological campaign and a disciplinary campaign, which were not only synchronized but also feed into one another to achieve a shared goal. Second, the campaign became politicized around midterm and intensified afterwards. The pace of progress of the campaign coincided with Xi Jinping's advancement of power. Third, the most significant outcome of Xi Jinping's campaign is not the numbers of disciplined corrupt officials but the paradigm-change in the disciplinary regime of the Party: first, the reversal of the depoliticization process of the Party's disciplinary regime; second, the retention of temporarily mobilized anticorruption resources; and third the simplification of evidence production procedure. The combined result is a considerable expansion of the CCDI's anticorruption investigative capacities and a significant increase Xi Jinping's leverage to impose political loyalty and compliance upon Party officials in the future."
"Politics, law, and administrative discretion: the case of work safety regulation in China.","Gao, Jie",Journal of Chinese Governance,Taylor & Francis Ltd,ADMINISTRATIVE discretion (Law); LEGISLATIVE bodies; COURTS; CHINA; SAFETY,Administrative discretion; delegation of power; regulation; rule of law; work safety,"Achieving a proper balance between administrative discretion, which promotes efficient and effective governance, and oversight of that discretion to ensure political responsiveness has been a classic and enduring issue in public-administration literature. This study joins the dialogue by examining the question in the context of China, where power is highly concentrated and there are not many checks and balances. By examining administrative discretion in work safety regulation, this study argues that in China's context, the tension between efficiency and responsiveness is less explicit among the legislature, executive and judiciary powers, but more explicit between central and local powers. In other words, if local bureaucracies have considerable discretionary power, they may use this power to achieve local interests at the expense of national goals. To improve local bureaucracies' political responsiveness, the Chinese leaders have adopted both legal and managerial measures. On the one hand, administrative discretion has been increasingly curbed through elaborate legislation. On the other hand, management reforms play a crucial role in bringing local leaders' goals in line with national ones. China's efforts to balance administrative efficiency and political responsiveness suggest that each country must choose solutions in keeping with its own context and problems."

The rare-earth sanctions provide an opportunity to investigate claims of economic statecraft, power and interdependence, and the political implications of near-monopoly control of a resource critical for high-tech military, consumer, medical, and environmental industries. A vector error correction model statistically disentangles the effects of China's economic statecraft from their rare-earth quota and pricing policies. Prior to the sanctions, there was little international supply diversification. China's purported use of rare-earth elements was an economically costly diplomatic signal that demonstrated their potential leverage, but also had unintended consequences, as Japan moved to diversify rare-earth supplies and in doing so deepened diplomatic ties with China's neighbors. Economic statecraft served to heighten regional tensions and undermine the China's own end goals."
Popular conceptions of democracy and democratic satisfaction in China.,"Zhai, Yida",International Political Science Review,"Sage Publications, Ltd.",DEMOCRACY; POLITICAL systems; POLITICAL doctrines; MODERNIZATION (Social science); CHINA -- Politics & government -- 2002-,China; democratic satisfaction; liberal democratic values; modernization; Popular conceptions of democracy,"Evaluating attitudes to democracy in an authoritarian political system is complex. Several surveys suggest that the majority of Chinese people feel satisfied with the level of democracy in China. In explaining this intellectual puzzle, this study addresses how different understandings of democracy influence satisfaction with the state of democracy. This study also investigates the relationships between liberal democratic values and popular conceptions of democracy, and between liberal democratic values and satisfaction with democracy. The results show that Chinese citizens who view elections and political rights as essential to democracy are dissatisfied with the current state of democracy. People who hold liberal democratic values are also dissatisfied with the current state of democracy. In other words, popular conceptions of democracy make a difference in the people's satisfaction with the democratic level in China. With a rise in the population adhering to procedural conceptions of democracy, satisfaction with the level of democracy in China may decline in the future."
Popular culture and politics: re-narrating the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands dispute.,"Ling, LHM; Nakamura, Mari",Cambridge Review of International Affairs,Taylor & Francis Ltd,SOVEREIGNTY; INTERNATIONAL conflict; POPULAR culture; SOCIAL reality; CHINA-Japan relations,,"Narrative, we argue, can (re)construct social reality. Alternative imaginaries of 'being in the world' can lead to alternative ways of 'doing in the world'. We discuss the current dispute between China and Japan over the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands as an example. Westphalian logic would have the two countries come to blows, if not go to war, over the Islands. The Westphalian account of the dispute centres on the key principle of sovereignty. But what if we utilized a different imaginary to re-narrate the conflict? We turn to popular culture in both Japan and China as a guide, and juxtapose two anime, Appleseed and Time of Eve, with one Chinese TV drama, Nirvana in Fire. Each of these upends conventional analyses of the Islands dispute and offers alternative conceptions of sovereignty. We conclude by considering the implications of such alternative imaginaries for the study, if not practice, of international relations."
Popular democratic perception matters for political trust in authoritarian regimes.,"Zhai, Yida",Politics,Sage Publications Inc.,DEMOCRACY; AUTHORITARIANISM; DEMOCRATIZATION; CHINA; POLITICAL trust (in government),China; democratization; governmental performance; political trust; popular perception of democracy,"Governmental performance is important for maintaining the public's political trust. This article examines the moderating role of the popular perceptions of democracy on the effect of governmental performance on political trust in authoritarian regimes by studying the case of China. The popular perceptions of democracy affect the evaluations of governmental performance, and the effects of governmental performance on political trust are contingent on particular democratic perception. The results reveal that a better government's social performance particularly increases political trust among people who view elections as an essential component of democracy. However, such a positive effect is significantly reduced among people who consider political rights to be a key component of democracy. Regardless of how Chinese people view democracy, government's poor political performance reduces people's political trust in the government. However, the negative effect is most significant among people who prioritize political rights in their perception of democracy. For those who view economic security as an essential component of democracy, the negative effect of the government's poor political performance on political trust is substantially attenuated."
Population Planning after the One-Child Policy: Shifting Modes of Political Steering in China.,"Alpermann, Björn; Zhan, Shaohua",Journal of Contemporary China,Taylor & Francis Ltd,"POPULATION policy; POLITICAL leadership; FAMILY planning; ONE-child policy, China; FORCED abortion; BIRTH control",,"Since late 2013, one of China's most controversial policies—the one-child policy—has been gradually phased out, culminating in the reorganization of the National Health and Family Planning Commission in early 2018, which saw it drop the family planning part from its name. Has China forgone population intervention and started to pursue a liberal population policy? This article demonstrates that the Chinese political leadership is still determined to steer the direction of future demographic developments, even though it changed course and has to employ new modes of steering. In fact, it has even elevated political steering of demographic developments to new heights under the rubric of 'top-level design' (dingceng sheji). This study takes a comparative look at the two ends of the life course, birth and old age, to reveal the continuity and change in population planning and policy discourses in China. In sum, this article finds that while the 'one-child policy' is gone for good, population planning in a broader understanding—including policies on birth, aging, migration, and urbanization—is alive and well and it will stay here for the foreseeable future."
Postcolonial Land Governance in Pakistan: Exclusionary Practices on State-Owned Farms.,"Mehmood, Asif",South Asia Research,Sage India,FOOD security; LAND tenure; PAKISTAN; FARMERS; FARMS,China-Pakistan Economic Corridor projects; development; farmers; food security; land governance; Pakistan; postcoloniality; securitisation; state-owned farms,"Current developments in Pakistan highlight the unresolved issue of proprietary rights for long-standing tenants of state-owned farms comprising thousands of acres in various districts of Punjab. The pendulum of state response to the hereditary claims of people who have lived and worked on this land for generations swings presently towards expropriation, rather than respect for rural people's basic rights. The scenario is further complicated because the military is a significant party to these disputes. This article scrutinises the handling of these protracted disputes over land rights and identifies emerging patterns of land governance in Pakistan that will alter the future relationship of these farmers with the government. The article shows that in this specific case, the problems are not merely a continuation of traditional local feudal powers, but now relate to new postcolonial realities, especially Pakistan's economic co-operation with China."

This article showcases the effects of a culturally relevant and sustainable psychosocial capacity-building project at the epicenter of the 2008 Wenchuan Earthquake. Specifically, the project focuses on women, a group that has received limited attention in post-disaster recovery in China. This qualitative research study (N = 14) sheds light on the characteristics and processes of the implementation of a post-disaster psychosocial intervention project in rural China. In addition, by adopting the Success Case Method as an evaluation approach, this study elucidates its effects on the psychological and social changes of the disaster victims. The findings capture five aspects of psychosocial changes: enriched daily life, better mood, enhanced self-confidence, increased willingness to socialize, and the provision of mutual help. This study hopes to encourage more culturally relevant and empowering practices for women in building their psychosocial capacity after disasters."

This process was further symbolized by the presence of Xi and the senior Chinese leadership at a concert by a flagship North Korean art troupe in Beijing. The no-deal Trump-Kim summit in Hanoi left Kim empty handed and caught the Chinese leadership by surprise, removing any possibility of a fifth Xi-Kim meeting during Kim's return train ride through China from Vietnam. It left Beijing concerned about the impasse, but hopeful that a mutual compromise might be salvaged. South Korean President Moon Jaein's reaction to the Hanoi summit failure had much in common with that of Beijing. But despite the visit to Beijing by Prime Minister Lee Nak-yon, smog hangs over China-ROK relations. Post-THAAD fallout and recriminations toward China resulting from worsening air pollution across the peninsula will set the diplomatic agenda for China-ROK relations through the rest of 2019."
Poverty affects access to regular source of primary care among the general population in Hong Kong.,"Chung, Roger Yat‐Nork; Chan, Dicken; Chau, Nancy Nam‐Sze; Huang, Suki; Wong, Hung; Wong, Samuel Yeung‐Shan",Social Policy & Administration,Wiley-Blackwell,POVERTY; HONG Kong (China); PRIMARY care; HEALTH disparities; MEDICAL care use; COMORBIDITY,deprivation; health inequality; Hong Kong; multimorbidity; poverty; primary care,"A territory‐wide two‐stage stratified random sample of 2,282 community‐dwelling Hong Kong adults were surveyed between 2014 and 2015 to investigate the association between poverty and regular source of primary care utilization. Poverty was operationalized by income‐poverty and deprivation. About 94% of our sample reported having regular source of primary care (Western and/or Chinese medical practitioner) and about 69% among them were in private sector. Multivariable logistic regression showed that people who were income‐poor and deprived were less likely to have regular source of primary care (income‐poor: OR = 0.523, p =.027; deprived: OR = 0.488, p =.007) and visit private primary care doctors (income‐poor: OR = 0.445, deprived: OR = 0.222, both p <.0001). Those who had chronic diseases were more likely to have regular source of primary care (multimorbid: OR = 10.709, p <.0001), but less likely to access care in the private sector (one chronic disease: OR = 0.690, p =.019; multimorbid: OR = 0.374, p <.0001) than those without. Further, being older and less skilled were significantly associated with less likelihood of visiting a private doctor. Path analysis showed that the number of chronic diseases had significant indirect effect on having regular source of primary care with being income‐poor and deprived as the mediators (β = −.0183, p =.0016). Therefore, despite a public health‐care system that aims to deny no one from adequate health care for lack of means, regular source of primary care in Hong Kong is found to be pro‐rich. Future policies should tackle the problem of health‐care inequalities to meet the needs of the underprivileged."

Photovoltaic-based development intervention programs have substantial potential in alleviating poverty, but implementing them in remote rural areas remains challenging. This study evaluates China's recent national policy to reduce poverty through government-led photovoltaic-based intervention in 471 counties of 16 provinces. We took a spatial approach to analyze program targeting, and applied a spatial lag model to examine the determinants of its implementation. The findings indicate that the program, which targets at counties that are poorer and endowed with greater solar radiation, can potentially make an unprecedented contribution to poverty reduction. However, far fewer counties and households are included in implementation plans, indicating tremendous challenges to carry out the program. We find counties with implementation plans tend to be spatially clustered, and major constraints to implementation include poor grid infrastructure, sparse population density, and low economic activities in rural areas. We suggest a more flexible PV-based intervention program that takes account of the specific socio-economic and environmental contexts of counties can generate greater impact on addressing the 'last mile problem' of poverty reduction in remote rural areas in China."

Asia is experiencing the initial throes of this shift, where the key protagonists are the United States, the established power or hegemon, and China, the rising challenger and peer competitor. This article argues that the ongoing geopolitical competition between the United States and China is best viewed as a competition over the hierarchy of prestige, with China seeking to replace the US as the most prestigious state in the international system within the next thirty years. Although the competition is a global one, with China having made significant economic–political inroads into Africa, Latin America and even Europe, Asia is where China must establish its prestige or 'reputation for power' in the first instance. China seeks the top seat in the hierarchy of prestige, and the US will do everything in its power to maintain its pole position, because the state with the greatest reputation for power gets to govern the region: it will attract more followers, regional powers will defer to and accommodate it, and it will play a decisive role in shaping the rules and institutions of international relations. In a word, the state at the top of the prestige hierarchy gets to translate its power into the political outcomes it desires with minimal resistance and maximum flexibility."
Power Plays and Balancing Acts: The Paradoxical Effects of Chinese Trade on African Foreign Policy Positions.,"Carmody, Pádraig; Dasandi, Niheer; Mikhaylov, Slava Jankin",Political Studies,Sage Publications Inc.,INTERNATIONAL trade; ECONOMIC policy; UNITED Nations; CHINA -- Foreign economic relations; AFRICA -- Foreign economic relations; AFRICA,Africa; China; foreign policy preferences; General Assembly; General Debate; text analysis; trade; United Nations,"There has been substantial focus on China's influence in Africa in recent years. Some argue that China's growing economic ties with African states have increased its political influence across the continent. This article examines whether trade with China leads African states to adopt more similar foreign policy preferences to China in the United Nations. We examine foreign policy similarity using voting patterns in the United Nations General Assembly and country statements in the United Nations General Debate. The analysis demonstrates that more trade with China has paradoxical effects on foreign policy positions of African states—it leads them to align more closely with US foreign policy positions in the United Nations, except on human rights votes. Our findings suggest that African states are engaged in balancing behavior with external powers whereby African elites seek to play off rival powers against one another in order to strengthen their own autonomy and maximize trade."
"Power Sharing, Patronage, and Land Institutions in China.","Sun, Xin",Problems of Post-Communism,Taylor & Francis Ltd,LAND use; PROPERTY rights; CHINA; REAL estate development; BENEFIT parties; SHARING,,"This article examines how single-party regimes share power among their ruling elites. An examination of land institutions in China suggests that the ruling Party relies on a statist and partially centralized land regime to distribute land development rights (land quotas). This institutional arrangement allows the Party's central elites to use land as patronage to build their clientelistic networks and share power among themselves. This argument is tested empirically using a data set of land-use conversion in Chinese provinces between 1999 and 2013. The findings of the research contribute to the literature on authoritarianism and land politics, and have important implications for land-institution reforms in China."
Power Transition and Paradigm Shift in Diplomacy: Why China and the US March towards Strategic Competition?,"Professor, Jianren Zhou Associate",Chinese Journal of International Politics,Oxford University Press / USA,DIPLOMACY; INTERNATIONAL relations; WORLD War II; CHINA; UNITED States,,"The rise of China is one of the most notable events in the early 21st century. The strategic impacts of its rise and interactions between the hegemonic power and the rising power have become focal points for scholars in the field of international relations. This article uses prospect theory, power transition theory, and nuclear deterrence theory as the basis for constructing a theory of strategic competition to explain the relationship between the hegemonic power and the rising power, and the strategic interactions between them during the power transition process. This new theory of strategic competition maintains that states take diplomatic actions not just to seek gains, but also to avoid losses. Building upon a critical review and revision of power transition theory, the theory of strategic competition proposes that before the rising power overtakes it, the hegemonic power will take action to avoid incurring losses, and that in response the rising power will passively take action to avoid its own losses. After the rising power has overtaken the hegemonic power, however, it will take action to expand its interests, and the hegemonic power will then passively take action to avoid its own losses. Under the inhibitive influence of nuclear deterrence, strategic competition between the hegemonic power and the rising power is limited to peaceful measures including diplomatic means. This article tests the theory of strategic competition through examining the paradigm shifts in diplomacy of the US and China that have occurred since 2010."
"Precarity, Cognitive (Non-)Resistance and the Conservative Working Class in China.","Lin, Jake",Journal of Contemporary Asia,Taylor & Francis Ltd,PRECARITY; WORKING class; EQUALITY; LABOR movement; CHINA; RESISTANCE (Psychoanalysis); CAPITAL movements,China; class politics; cognitive resistance; labour; neo-liberalism; precarity,"Workers' resistance is crucial to understanding how the working class respond to the growing labour precarity in post-socialist China. The labour studies literature posits that inequality and volatile capital movements increase workers' precarity and lead to stronger labour resistance, such as strikes. However, workers' cognition as an integral part of resistance has been rarely studied. This article examines cognitive resistance by Chinese workers from different tier cities by looking at their social trust, class identity, understanding of policies and class solidarity. Despite capital movements and precarity causing more labour unrest, it does not necessarily lead to a stronger cognitive resistance. While inequality and precarity are greater in the more developed megacities with a shifting capital favourability, workers in megacities display a more conservative cognitive resistance than those from the lower-tier cities. This study of workers' cognitive resistance provides insight into the future of the Chinese labour movement. It argues that the working class's current cognitive non-resistance suggests that even if a window of opportunity were to appear in the wall of state oppression, workers are not cognitively prepared to coalesce into a coherent social movement that would bring about transformative changes."

Preferential policies for China's ethnic minorities at a crossroads.,"Hoshino, Masahiro",Journal of Contemporary East Asia Studies,Taylor & Francis Ltd,MINORITIES; GOVERNMENT policy; POWER (Social sciences); CHINESE Communist Party; ROAD interchanges & intersections,ethnic minority policy; regional ethnic autonomy; Tibet; Uyghur; Xinjiang,"Background: The Chinese government's principle of regional ethnic autonomy has remained consistent since the founding of the PRC in 1949. However, some voices within the country are calling on the government to rethink the principle of ethnic autonomy. Purpose: This paper discusses two examples in support of the hypothesis that the system favoring ethnic minorities under the regional autonomy system implemented since the foundation of modern China has reached a turning point. Main Argument: The first example describes the government's handling of ethnic minority issues, in particular the July 2009 disturbances in Urumqi in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. The second outlines the political discussion of the regional ethnic autonomy system, with open discussion in the past few years about changing the system advanced by an individual formerly directly involved in formulating and implementing ethnic policies. Conclusion: The first example demonstrates that the government's policy of expanding preferential measures favoring ethnic minorities in order to stabilize restive autonomous regions has become untenable. The second highlights that the government's confidence in its hard-line measures, even to the extent of allowing open discussion within China of whether the regional ethnic autonomy system should be reevaluated. This paper's conclusion is that preferential policies for China's ethnic minorities are at a crossroads."
President XI's Surveillance State.,"Qiang, Xiao",Journal of Democracy,Johns Hopkins University Press,"MASS surveillance; INTERNET security; XI, Jinping, 1953-",,"Since President Xi Jinping came to power in 2012, China has significantly increased controls over its already censored cyberspace—with a ruling that will allow jail terms for spreading ""rumors"" online, a cybersecurity law that will facilitate state control and data access, crackdowns on unauthorized VPN connections, and emphasis on the concept of ""internet sovereignty."" At the same time, technological innovations in such areas as big-data analytics, artificial intelligence, and the Internet of Things are increasingly being harnessed to monitor the lives and activities of China's 1.4 billion people. The new arsenal of the Chinese surveillance state includes mass video-surveillance projects incorporating facial-recognition technology; voice-recognition software that can identify speakers on phone calls; and a sweeping and intrusive program of DNA collection. In addition, officials are at work on a nationwide Social Credit System (SCS) intended to assess the conduct of every Chinese citizen."
Presidential Turnover and Discontinuity in the Philippines' China Policy.,"Tran, Bich T.",Asian Perspective,Johns Hopkins University Press,,,"Philippines-China relations have experienced dramatic turns, from a ""golden age"" to ""Asia's most toxic bilateral relationship,"" followed by a new ""spring time,"" as described by the media. Why does the Philippines' China policy oscillate so much? This article looks at the role of the president in the Philippines' foreign policymaking by examining the country's China policy under the leadership of three Philippines' presidents: Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, Benigno Aquino III, and Rodrigo Duterte. The findings show that although individual presidents have opportunities to promote their own preferences in dealing with China, they are not free from constraints. Despite showing great oscillations in rhetoric, the actual policies undertaken by each administration have never completely shifted to one or another extreme of the Sino-American spectrum: balancing against China using the alliance with the United States, or bandwagoning with China at the cost of losing the alliance with the United States."

This paper uses attribution theory to investigate how Chinese newspapers and non-Chinese newspapers presented smog in China and attributed causes and responsibilities. Built on previous studies, this study adopted covariation model within attribution theory and painted an interesting picture of smog coverage by Chinese and non-Chinese newspapers because of the apparent differences in perspectives. The criteria further provided folder for elaboration on explaining why the different coverages attributed causes as they did. Implications are discussed."
Private Think Tanks and Public–Private Partnerships in Chinese Public Diplomacy.,"Li, Li; Chen, Xuefei; Hanson, Elizabeth C.",Hague Journal of Diplomacy,Brill Academic Publishers,DIPLOMACY; STAKEHOLDERS; RESEARCH institutes; NON-state actors (International relations); PUBLIC-private sector cooperation,China; public diplomacy; public-private partnerships; think tanks; track-two diplomacy,"Summary: This article examines private think tanks as instruments of public diplomacy in China. It analyses relationship-building in three cases of a hybrid form of public diplomacy that combines government agencies and non-state actors and involves multiple stakeholders, both domestic and transnational. Emphasis is upon the actors in China that initiated the projects and developed the networks for each initiative, but the building of the projects' transnational relationships is also considered. The cases involve three top-ranking Chinese private think tanks: the Charhar Institute's City Diplomacy projects; the Center for China and Globalization's Green Card initiative; and the Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies' Think 20 Transnational Network. The analysis demonstrates how and why the public-private partnerships in each case produced shared positive outcomes with synergistic results and advanced China's public diplomacy objectives. The cases illustrate the advantages of a hybrid form of non-state public diplomacy that combines state and non-state actors."
Producing a Distant Centre: The role of wilderness in the post-Mao Tibetan Buddhist revival.,"CHO, YASMIN; Marsden, Magnus; Reeves, Madeleine",Modern Asian Studies,Cambridge University Press,BUDDHISM; BUDDHISTS; WILDERNESS areas; CHINA; ETHNOGRAPHIC analysis; REVIVALS (Religion); SOCIAL space,,"This article addresses how wilderness—through its qualities of remoteness and wildness—plays an essential role in the production of a vital religious centre in Tibet. By drawing on in-depth ethnographic observations in Yachen Gar, a mega-sized Buddhist encampment in the nomadic grasslands of China's northwestern Sichuan province, I examine the spatial and material features of the encampment, how various agents utilize these features to produce specific relations with it, and how, in this process, Yachen has become a centre of the Buddhist revival in Kham Tibet. I will present three ethnographic accounts—which focus on a Tibetan nun from the Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR), Chinese pilgrims, and reactions to the spread of electricity in Yachen—to address the ways in which Yachen is emplaced within the spatial and material tensions implemented and imagined by different participants. These accounts ultimately show how materiality plays a crucial role in forging the various contesting relations, actions, and meanings that constitute a social space."
Product relatedness and export specialisation in China's regions: a perspective of global–local interactions.,"Mao, Xiyan; He, Canfei","Cambridge Journal of Regions, Economy & Society",Oxford University Press / USA,EXPORTS; SUPPLY & demand; PATH dependence (Social sciences); COMMODITY futures; CHINA -- Foreign relations,China; export specialisation; global–local interactions; path dependence; relatedness,"This article investigates the product relatedness that generates the dynamics of regional export specialisations in China. Conventional 'relatedness' concerns local portfolios, which is insufficient to capture the global–local interactive nature of export specialisation. We propose a framework consisting of relatedness embedded in commodity structures and trade networks. It considers interactions between domestic supply and overseas demand, and between internal market competition and external market expansion. The empirical study based on 334 prefectures in China during 2001–2013 supports the theoretical prediction. The findings suggest that the development policy for export-oriented regions should consider both capacity building internally and network construction externally."
Projecting Political Power: China's Changing Maritime Strategy.,"Zhao, Kejin; Zhang, Hao",Chinese Journal of International Politics,Oxford University Press / USA,POWER (Social sciences); STRATEGIC planning; SOCIAL structure; SCHOLARS; CHINA; CHINA -- Politics & government -- 2002-,,"Policy communities throughout the world tend to agree that in recent years China has become more assertive in its maritime disputes with neighbouring countries. However, scholars vehemently disagree about the underlying motivations for such a change, whether structural factors, China's external pressures, or growing overseas interests. This article argues that existing analysis runs the risk of dismissing the embedded logic of domestic legitimacy as the single most important explanation. China's maritime strategy has almost always served the goal of legitimisation in consistence with the Party's central enterprises, be they survival, modernisation, or political influence/power. The rise of naval nationalism from within has pushed the central leadership to respond with determination for the sake of maintaining credibility as 'national saviour and protector'. More importantly, in view of the bureaucratic fragmentation in China's maritime governance, new policy actors can forward their own interests by appealing to nationalist sentiments, and to the Party's new central task of projecting political power. Our case studies on Sansha City, the Diaoyu/Senkaku Islands, and the Haiyang Shiyou 981 Drilling Rig bring in supportive evidence. Specifically, they demonstrate that all extant explanations may indeed influence China's maritime strategy, but mostly through their impact on domestic legitimacy. Based on our legitimacy thesis, it can be predicted that, if the central leadership manages to consolidate its domestic legitimacy, China will assume a more moderate, cooperative, and constructive attitude towards maritime disputes."
"Propaganda intelligence and covert action: the Regional Information Office and British intelligence in South-East Asia, 1949-1961.","Shaw, Alexander Nicholas",Journal of Intelligence History,Taylor & Francis Ltd,ESPIONAGE; INTELLIGENCE service; SOUTHEAST Asia; GREAT Britain,China; covert action; Far East; Information Research Department; Singapore,"This article explores the intersections between propaganda, intelligence and covert action through the experience of Britain's Regional Information Office (RIO) in Singapore. RIO defined its functions as 'propaganda intelligence': the generation of intelligence to guide propaganda output and analysis of enemy propaganda to feed into the broader intelligence picture of communist intentions. This highlights the interdependency of intelligence and propaganda. RIO worked closely with MI5 and MI6 in developing intelligence on communist China and North Vietnam. Evaluating the position of RIO within Britain's regional intelligence network also reveals some of the complexities of the late-imperial intelligence system. It illuminates the changing status of different intelligence activities and the growth of a particular intelligence culture, providing insight into how Britain engaged with the clandestine Cold War in South-East Asia."
Propagation of changes in demand through international trade: A case study of China.,"Andritzky, Jochen; Kassner, Bernhard; Reuter, Wolf Heinrich",World Economy,Wiley-Blackwell,ECONOMIC change; INTERNATIONAL trade; GROSS domestic product; INPUT-output analysis; ECONOMIC conditions in China,China; input–output; shock propagation; trade channel,"China's economy, the second largest in the world, is undergoing a fundamental transition. Its transition from a strong focus on investment and exports towards a larger share of consumption could have important ramifications for China's trading partners. Using China as a case study, this paper deploys a sectoral input–output (IO) analysis to take into account higher‐round spillovers from a reduction of import demand or a shift in the composition of the Chinese economy. This approach demonstrates strong indirect effects that exceed by far the initial shock from direct trade links, reflecting China's integration into a closely knit global value chain. The result suggests that the ongoing transition in China will have important effects on the global economy."

Protect the unprotected: the escaping North Korean issue and China's dual dilemma of theoretical enlightenment and operational trial.,"Tseng, Hui-Yi Katherine",Pacific Review,Taylor & Francis Ltd,REFUGEES; NORTH Korea; CHINA; BANGKOK (Thailand); CONVENTION Relating to the Status of Refugees (1951),1951 Refugee Convention; Asian values; Bangkok principles; geopolitics; politicization; Refugee,"Escalating tensions in the Peninsula may force voluminous North Koreans to leave the country, although relevant information is limited. China has refused to grant North Korean escapees the refugee status, because the main reason of their departure, economic hardship, is not prescribed in conventional refugee definition. The Bangkok Principles provide principal guidance to Asia's refugee issues, whereto its non-legally binding framework helps facilitate the fledgling regional efforts and still-developing states' wills. Yet, China's insistence in distinguishing economic hardship from political causes reifies its overt cautions to the rapidly evolving refugee causes, and an outright rejection to the indiscriminate humanitarian nature of refugee protection. Another reason is China's 'Asian Values' approach to human right, seeing various aspects of human right as separable. To grant refugees only partial rights would appear theoretically unsound, and blatantly contradicting its integral human-right essence. Realistically, China has only limited refugee reception experiences. Its relevant domestic mechanism is under-developed, whereby positive public opinions cannot be effectively remoulded. China also worries about the unwanted international attentions and entailed geopolitical implications, which imply denunciation of Pyongyang's governance performance by formally identifying these escapees, refugees. Current dramatic changes in inter-Korean relations urge China to take swift, expedient, and substantive actions."

"Provincial Power in a Centralizing China: The Politics of Domestic and International ""Development Space"".","Jaros, Kyle A.; Tan, Yeling",China Journal,University of Chicago Press,"ECONOMIC development; POLITICAL economic analysis; INTERNATIONAL economic integration; XI, Jinping, 1953-",,"In a Xi Jinping era of rising central power and policy activism, what role is left for Chinese provinces? This article argues that, notwithstanding centralizing tendencies, China's recent economic development trajectory cannot be understood without taking into account the distinctive policy roles and priorities of provincial governments. Successive waves of governance restructuring have in many ways strengthened rather than weakened provincial authorities, reinforcing their role as central-local gatekeepers within China's political economy. In particular, we draw attention to the ways that provinces create and shape ""development space"" (fazhan kongjian 发展空间) for different industries and localities and alter the contours of China's international economic engagement. We explore how provinces use their position as brokers of development space to concentrate investment in privileged areas of the economy while neglecting other aspects of development, deviating from central priorities in the process. Using case studies about industrial policy, rural development, and foreign economic relations, we show how—even in an era of centralism—provinces' developmental drive remains untamed."
Provisional Arrangements Pending Maritime Delimitation in the South China Sea: Practices and Prospects.,Quan Ye,Korean Journal of Defense Analysis,Korea Institute for Defense Analyses,INTERNATIONAL conflict; MARITIME law; BOUNDARY disputes; INTERNATIONAL cooperation; SOUTH China Sea,disputed maritime areas; joint development; maritime delimitation; provisional arrangement; South China Sea disputes,"As an extremely delicate and sensitive matter, it is unrealistic to expect the eventual resolution of maritime delimitation disputes in the South China Sea (SCS) in the immediate future. To manage the disputes and utilize the disputed maritime area, the claimants in this region have made continued efforts to conclude provisional arrangements. Due to the lack of consensus on the precise disputed zones and the low political will to make concessions, the existing arrangements have several drawbacks. To break the stalemate, a set of approaches are indispensable. A reasonable first step might be to develop provisional arrangements in less disputed maritime areas, especially those areas involving only two states. For areas with multiple claims or where the claimants have low political will to cooperate, it is advisable to start with developing arrangements on issues with common interests and easy to implement. For higher sensitive issues, track two connections might be employed at first, so as to pave the way for future official cooperation."
Public administration and the erosion of the rule of law in the United States.,"Rosenbloom, David H.",Journal of Chinese Governance,Taylor & Francis Ltd,PUBLIC administration; REFORMERS; LEGISLATIVE bodies; POLICY sciences; UNITED States,Chevron doctrine; constitutional distortion; Public administration; rule of law; unitary executive branch theory,"The failure of public administration theorists, researchers, reformers, and practitioners to make the rule of law the foundation of U.S. public administration has contributed to an erosion of constitutionality and legality in the national administration. Prominent contemporary threats to the rule of law include standardless delegations of legislative authority to administrative agencies, theChevrondoctrine and related judicial deference, the use of administrative guidance documents in place of rules, presidential legislation by executive order, aggrandizement through unitary executive branch theory, and policymaking by concerted nonenforcement of statutory requirements. Together, these threats contribute to massive constitutional distortion. This raises questions of whether it is time for public administration theorists, researchers, and practitioners to consider a 'rule of law restoration' initiative in the U.S. and use the American case examined here as a potential basis for considering the role of the rule of law in contemporary public administration worldwide."

The core of the crisis is how to address the relationship between public administration and the three major related disciplines—political science, management, and law; especially the first two—and whether public administration is an independent scientific subject. By studying the discipline identity problem of public administration using the three-perspective framework of politics, management, and law developed by Rosenbloom, this article argues that the developmental history of Chinese public administration is also a history of the relationship between public administration and the three major related disciplines. Furthermore, after comparing United States and Chinese public administration, the article suggests that we can define public administration as a dynamic balance and integrative science across the three major related disciplines by placing greater emphasis on administration, public management, and the laws and rules of administration and public management. This new definition suggests that seeking dynamic balance and synthesis is the nature of public administration, differentiates public administration from other disciplines, and stresses its status as an independent discipline. Thus, we do not need to be frightened of this feature of public administration or reframe it but must instead admit that this unique feature represents a specific advantage of public administration. Furthermore, this view provides a new way to dismiss the nightmare-like identity crisis faced by public administration."

Regression results reveal most of these indicators are significantly related to the overall evaluation of society though with different explanatory power. This study not only helps understand how Chinese people evaluate their society but also calls attention to further improve social quality indicator system."
"Public Goods, Club Goods, and Private Interests:: The Influence of Domestic Business Elites on British Counter-Piracy Interventions in the South China Sea, 1921–35.","Lucas, Edward R.",Security Studies,Taylor & Francis Ltd,ECONOMIC elites; PUBLIC goods; PIRACY (Maritime); INTERNATIONAL relations; LONDON (England); GREAT Britain; CLUB goods; BRITISH military,,"This paper sheds light on the question of how domestic elite preferences drive states' foreign policies by studying British efforts to suppress maritime piracy in the South China Sea in the 1920s and 1930s. The archival record shows that the British conducted military interventions, which included destroying entire Chinese villages, principally to serve the private aims of London business elites. Absent these parochial interests Britain ignored pirate attacks, including attacks on British-flagged ships. This finding challenges the standard structural explanation, put forward by global public goods scholars, that powerful maritime states suppress piracy to protect universal access to the global maritime commons. It does so through a detailed examination of the principal example cited by this argument's supporters: historical British counter-piracy efforts. Understanding why states pursue their foreign policies also provides a greater understanding of why powerful states choose to serve as global public goods providers in some instances but not in others."
Public Performance and Private Choices: Manying Actresses as New Women.,Yuxin Ma,American Journal of Chinese Studies,American Journal of Chinese Studies,"IMPERIALISM; CULTURE; SELF-perception; JAPANESE occupation of Manchuria, 1931-1945; JAPAN; ACTRESSES",Manchukuo; Manying actresses; Manying network; new women; patriarchal culture; personal interests; print media; private lives,"This article seeks to move beyond simplistic portrayals of the Chinese actresses who worked with the Manchuria Motion Picture Corporation (Manying) as either victims exploited by the Japanese management or traitorous collaborators. By exploring their social origins and their motivations for joining Manying, studying their lives and careers at Manying, and examining their choices and self-perceptions, the article argues that the Manying actresses should not be merely defined in terms of how they may have legitimated the Manchukuo state (1932-45). Rather, an examination of their quotidian lives shows how they developed performative skills, gained fame, and achieved mobility and opportunities. At the same time, their personal choices were often still political in nature, but in broad terms that could include opposition not only to Japanese imperialism but also to the patriarchal and sexist treatment of women and state intrusion into their private lives. Thus, they advocated for Chinese cultural differences to bring about changes in Manying personnel policies, which enabled them to keep their careers after marriage; and they used their resources to gain material advantages in the economic difficult context of the late Manchukuo years. Their Manying networks ultimately rescued them from wartime danger, sheltered them from difficulties found in other parts of China, and sustained them through the turbulence that arose after the collapse of Manchukuo. In this way, Manying actresses should be understood as “new women” who broke through traditional constraints to gain greater autonomous control over their own lives."
Public service motivation and performance: The role of organizational identification.,"Miao, Qing; Eva, Nathan; Newman, Alexander; Schwarz, Gary",Public Money & Management,Taylor & Francis Ltd,CIVIL service; PUBLIC administration; CHINA; JOB performance; ORGANIZATIONAL identification,China; organizational identification; performance; public service motivation,"Although the association between public service motivation (PSM) and job performance has received increased attention, there is limited knowledge of the mechanisms underlying its effects. Utilizing data from Chinese civil servants and their supervisors, the authors found that PSM results in higher levels of organizational identification and leads to higher levels of job performance because civil servants perceive the organization's fate and results as their own. IMPACT Our study demonstrates that organizational identification is a key mechanism that explains how public service motivation (PSM) leads to higher levels of performance. To improve performance, public agencies should create an environment that helps employees identify with the organization, for example by highlighting the distinct services that the organization provides for the public and by establishing socialization practices for newcomers."
"Public-private coordination in large emerging economies: the case of Brazil, India and China.","May, Christian; Nölke, Andreas; ten Brink, Tobias",Contemporary Politics,Taylor & Francis Ltd,PUBLIC-private sector cooperation; ECONOMIC development; INTERNATIONAL relations; INTERNATIONAL trade; BRICS countries,Brazil; China; comparative capitalism; economic coordination; India; State capitalism,"Different modes of economic coordination constitute a key aspect of the Comparative Capitalisms research framework. With regard to emerging economies, the close relationship between the state and business has been perceived negatively as an instance of corruption and patrimonialism that are considered to be economically harmful. This paper addresses the puzzle why some large emerging economies – China, India, and Brazil in particular – have seen considerable economic growth since the 2000s despite such 'failures' or 'institutional deficits'. We find strong evidence for a public–private mode of coordination based on reciprocity. This inter-personal mode of coordination helps to explain an unexpected degree of institutional coherence of capitalism, albeit to different degrees, in the large emerging economies under scrutiny. We argue that while there is evidence of economically productive public–private coordination in China and India, economic coordination in Brazil by comparison is much more contested, and thus less beneficial economically."
Pulling the Region into its Orbit?

Following the Monroe doctrine, Latin America has long been seen as part of the sphere of U.S. influence. For the purpose of studying the effectiveness of China's economic statecraft I will focus on two countries that stand on opposite extremes: Brazil and Mexico. Both countries happened to be important target states (strategic partners) of China's economic statecraft in the region, albeit for different political and strategic goals. In this paper I will compare the different domestic political and economic conditions, interests and institutions in these two countries to explain why China has made greater progress in projecting its economic power through trade and investment to pursue its political goals with Brazil, but has not succeeded in Mexico."
Punish the Dissidents: The Selective Implementation of Stability Preservation in China.,"Liu, Dongshu",Journal of Contemporary China,Taylor & Francis Ltd,DISSENTERS; AUTHORITARIANISM; RULE of law; PUNISHMENT; AUTHORITARIAN personality; CHINA; ILLEGITIMACY,,"Authoritarian regimes face a dilemma in punishing dissidents. They need extralegal punishments to ensure social stability, but they also want to legalize punishment decisions to sustain an image of adherence to the rule of law. These contradictory goals present an agency problem: local officials must selectively implement the competing goals of the central government. By analyzing data on 1408 dissidents in China from 2007 to 2014, this article argues that local officials are more likely to select legitimate punishments when they experience stronger pressure for career development and their province has a wealthier local economy. These findings reveal the effects of the principal-agent problem on the dynamics of stability preservation in China and indicate that punishment decisions serve not only the needs of regime survival but also the needs of individual officials."

However, despite the ample scholarship on the Confucius Institute, a large-N empirical assessment is missing. In this study, we make an original and important contribution to the literature by conducting a large-N empirical analysis to demonstrate how China employs the Confucius Institute to maximize soft power in the era of China's rise. Based on a new dataset that includes all world countries from 2004 to 2014, our large-N analysis shows that the Confucius Institute is designed to promote China's educational, economic, and political interests altogether. These interesting empirical findings constitute arguably the first systematic evidence to demonstrate how China designs the Confucius Institute to maximize soft power."

Through the period of the end of First Opium War (1842) and suppression of the Boxer Rebellion, the Qing Empire opens access to their ports for foreign states, which expand their influence in the region through practical division of the country into zones of habitation. The main instrument here is the foreign settlements, which have different legal status and various tasks, but serve as certain indicator of power and influence. The settlements often bordered each other, and their inhabitants commuted across the empire as well as in these territories, which prompted the need for regulation of the emerging legal issues, conflicts and their consequences. For the first time the legal nature of foreign settlements is being researched, as well as the status of their borders, since it defined and protected the interests of the state from infringement by the Qing Empire and the other states. While there were mostly no legal or border issues associated with the rental territories, which predominantly served as places of military presence, similar to current international military bases, position of diplomatic quarters produced rather contradictory opinions, analysis of which is carried out by the author."

Administrative racism is when public organizations severely harm people of color. This article argues that fake news based on racist ideas feed a climate where administrative racism becomes more likely. In one decade, from 1877–1887, the Republican Party drifted from its moorings as the party of emancipation, equal protection, and Reconstruction to creating the conditions in which anti-Black violence thrived, Chinese immigrants were legally excluded, and American Indian tribes were dispossessed of 80% of their treaty-promised land. According to historians, fake news spread racist ideas in ways that made each of these policies more likely. The legacies of that racist fake news and those policies impact modern debates on integration, immigration, and equality, with implications for public administration."
Rapid Urban Land Expansion in Earthquake-Prone Areas of China.,"Huang, Qingxu; Meng, Shiting; He, Chunyang; Dou, Yinyin; Zhang, Qiang",International Journal of Disaster Risk Science,Springer Nature,URBAN land use; EMERGENCY management; HAZARD mitigation; URBAN planning; SEISMIC hazard assessment,China; Most seismically hazardous areas; Seismic hazard exposure; Urban expansion; Urban sustainability; Urbanization,"A timely understanding of urban expansion in earthquake-prone areas is crucial for earthquake risk assessment and urban planning for earthquake mitigation. However, a comprehensive evaluation of urban expansion in earthquake-prone areas is lacking in China, especially in the context of rapid urbanization. Based on time series urban land data and seismic ground-motion parameter zonation maps, this study analyzed urban expansion in the most seismically hazardous areas (MSHAs) of China from 1992 to 2015 on the national, regional, and city scales. The results show that urban land area in the MSHAs expanded by 6767 km2 from 1992 to 2015, with a gain of 350%. Specifically, the increase in urban land area of small cities in the MSHAs of western China during this period was the fastest, 6.24 times greater than that at the national level. In terms of spatial patterns, the urban land patches in the MSHAs in 2015 were more fragmented than those in 1992 on all scales. The percentage of change in the number of patches and the landscape shape index of the urban land patches of small cities in the MSHAs of western China were the highest across all cities. Therefore, we believe that special attention should be paid to the cities in the MSHAs that exhibit the most rapid increases in both urban land area and fragmentation, especially the small cities in western China. It is imperative to integrate earthquake mitigation into the urban planning of these cities."
Reacting to China's rise throughout history: balancing and accommodating in East Asia.,"Meng, Weizhan; Hu, Weixing",International Relations of the Asia-Pacific,Oxford University Press / USA,"HISTORY; INTERNATIONAL relations; CHINA; EAST Asia; TANG dynasty, China, 618-907; HAN dynasty, China, 202 B.C.-220 A.D.; EAST Asians; ASIAN history; CHINESE history",,"The rise of China and how other countries respond to China's rising is widely studied. But little has been done on how other countries reacted to the rise of China throughout history and how China strategically interacted with them. The conventional wisdom holds East Asian international relations did not operate in the Westphalian way and China's rising in history did not trigger regional balancing actions. In this article, we challenge that view. We argue East Asian international relations were not exceptional to basic rules of the Westphalian system. Each time China rose up, it triggered balancing actions from neighboring regimes, including nomadic empires and settled kingdoms. The neighboring regimes would accommodate China only after they were defeated by China or pro-China regimes propped up in these countries. The Chinese hegemony in East Asian history could not be taken for granted. Over last 2,000 plus years, only during three periods of time (the Qin-Han 秦汉, Sui-Tang 隋唐, and Ming-Qing 明清 dynasties) China could successfully overpower regional resistance and enjoyed a stable tributary relationship with neighboring states. In the rest of time, the Chinese state could not retain hegemony in East Asia."
Reading the Trump Administration's China Policy.,"Kubo, Fumiaki",Asia-Pacific Review,Taylor & Francis Ltd,,,"The policy toward China under the Trump Administration is a rare combination of the toughest part of that of the Democratic Party, which is trade, and of the Republican Party, which is national security. The National Security Strategy by the Trump Administration defined China and Russia as competitors. It is the first time for the US Government to be harsh against both China and Russia (the Soviet Union included) since the late 1960s. Though trade is by far the most salient aspect of President Trump's confrontational China policy, it is in fact a whole-of-the-government approach or pushback that the US government is taking with China, which means that not just the White House but various Departments and the Congress are tough with China, dealing with many issues from trade to human rights to national security. The President might actually be the softest link, almost exclusively focusing on trade. This might be a historic turnaround in US policy toward China."
'Real interest'? Understanding the 2018 Agreement to Prevent Unregulated High Seas Fisheries in the Central Arctic Ocean.,"Dodds, Klaus",Global Policy,Wiley-Blackwell,GREEN movement; CONTRACTS; CHINA; FISHERIES; OCEAN; FISHERY management; FISH conservation,,"The 2018 Agreement to Prevent Unregulated High Seas Fisheries in the Central Arctic Ocean (Agreement) is a notable intervention in living resources management. The Agreement seeks to anticipate future fisheries management and serves as a reminder as how international legal frameworks such as UNCLOS 'regionalise' seas and oceans. But thus far analyses of the Agreement have tended to focus on its legal and managerial qualities and implications. This paper offers a different reading of the Agreement, informed by critical geopolitics, which focuses on how the Agreement actively produces 'the Central Arctic Ocean' (CAO) which it then seeks to manage. The Agreement will shape not only the future geopolitics of the Arctic Ocean but also the diverse array of interests held by Arctic Ocean coastal states, indigenous peoples, environmental groups and extra‐territorial parties such as China. Having 'due regard' for rights of others needs to co‐exist with coastal states eager to protect their sovereign rights. Managing 'due regard' and 'adjacency' will be challenging in the Central Arctic Ocean, present and future."

The Chinese leadership attempted to use aid to influence Hanoi's approach to the war, but achieved almost no effect. Instead, Beijing's manipulation made Hanoi suspicious about the Chinese leadership's real intentions in Indochina, and Beijing's effort to help Hanoi against the United States was arguably its biggest, unexpected foreign policy failure in the Cold War."

This research has largely ignored whether individuals also care about rewarding or punishing foreign countries for their policies on these issues. We tested this possibility by administering a series of conjoint and traditional survey experiments in the United States and China that examined how reciprocity influences opposition to foreign acquisitions of domestic companies. We find that reciprocity is an important determinant of public opinion on the regulation of foreign investments. This suggests the need to consider the policies that other countries adopt when trying to explain public attitudes toward global economic integration."

We identify the common features of relational approaches, including varieties of practice theory, pragmatism and network analysis. We also identify key disagreements within relationalism, such as the relative explanatory importance of positional and process-oriented analysis. Our discussion reveals the problems that come from associating relationalism solely with other clusters of international-relations theory, such as constructivism. It also allows us to construct a typology of major relational frameworks in the field, and provides a better foundation for comparing and contrasting Chinese and Western relationalisms."

While a number of scholars have regarded China's soft power as benign and lagging behind the U.S. in its technology and effect, a few other specialists have sounded the alarm, noting how China's soft power efforts have become highly sophisticated and their malign influence should rather be termed ""sharp power."" After examining these assessments of China's soft power or sharp power, this article points out the origins of the PRC sharp power efforts in longstanding CCP (Chinese Communist Party, a.k.a. the Communist Party of China, or CPC) ""thought-remolding"" practices, and draw attention to the intensification of such efforts under Xi Jinping. The article discusses the danger these efforts pose for liberal democracies (with a particular focus on Taiwan), the need to raise awareness within liberal societies, and possible strategies to resist China's sharp power. Finally, the article examines China's disinformation campaign against Hong Kong's anti-extradition bill protesters to illustrate the workings of a digital dictatorship China has developed for its sharp power operations, at home and abroad, and how the democracies may counter it."
Reconfiguring Chinese natures: frugality and waste reutilization in Mao era urban China.,"Liebman, Adam",Critical Asian Studies,Taylor & Francis Ltd,"ENVIRONMENTAL degradation; MARXIST analysis; CHINESE psychology; THRIFTINESS; RECYCLING (Waste, etc.)",China; Nature; socialism; translation; waste,"This article juxtaposes two conflicting images of China's environment during the socialist Mao era. One is an influential scholarly account of environmental destruction due to Mao's insistence that ""man must conquer nature"" (ren ding sheng tian). The other, provided by a longtime resident of Kunming, is an idyllic description of an urban material reuse system without waste. The different images involve variances in the very notions of nature and environment on which they are grounded. The former posits the Chinese tian as equivalent to a western environmentalist notion of nature, while the latter corresponds with a Marxist materialist notion that waste is part of nature's bounty. I explore the politics of fixing translational equivalents in the interplay between history, memory, and power by focusing on excesses of each image: Mao's tian as an impediment to cultivating collective agency, and forms of industrial pollution that were not signified by ""garbage."" Kunming city government documents further highlight crucial rifts in material flows that unfolded through the Mao era, complicating both images. Ultimately, by probing shifting Chinese ""natures,"" I clear conceptual space for capturing the important roles played by waste matter and practices of frugality in shaping recent Chinese history."

Rediscovering the Transition in China's National Interest: A Neoclassical Realist Approach.,"Ye, Xiaodi",Journal of Current Chinese Affairs,Sage Publications Inc.,NATIONAL interest; INTERNATIONAL relations; CHINA; SCHOLARS,China's national interest; Chinese foreign policy; neoclassical realism; transition process,"Recently, China's core national interest proposal has drawn significant attention from scholars, triggering a wide range of discussions on this interesting phenomenon. However, the existing literature remains largely limited to single-case studies and has neglected several crucial questions: What is the major difference between China's national interest and core national interest? What factors may cause a transition from a national interest to a core interest? How can we understand this long-term transition? Based on these questions, this article constructs a neoclassical-based analytical framework to trace that transition, arguing that the major difference between these two concepts is the scope of their application. Meanwhile, the transition in China's national interest can be categorised as ""defensive national interest,"" ""constructive national interest,"" and ""adversary core interest"" from the beginning of the 1980s to 2017 – with the scope expanded accordingly from the domestic and regional levels to the inter-regional one."

While existing studies have investigated the root of this narrative structure in Chinese traditions, this article tries to uncover Japan's lesser-known role in the revitalization of traditional discourses. It first discusses how Japanese intellectuals, such as Shiga Shigetaka and Naitō Konan, reconfigured Chinese discourses on the North–South dichotomy as theories to assert Japan's superiority over China. It goes on to examine how Liang Qichao appropriated Japanese theories to mobilize southern Chinese to participate in state politics. It then explores how Chinese revolutionary students in Japan exploited Japanese intellectuals' and Liang's discourses to promote a cross-provincial consciousness by representing China as a river-based region writ large. Lastly, it reveals how the restructured discourses on the North–South dichotomy were manipulated by revolutionaries after they flowed back to China."

In this essay, I offer reflections on After Victory's arguments about the character and evolution of international order in the modern era, American hegemonic order in the 20th century, and the logic of institutions and strategic restraint. I explore the theoretical debates that it engaged and triggered. The essay looks at how the book's arguments stand up to the face of more recent developments – the Bush administration's Iraq War, the rise of China, the American 'empire debate', and the Trump administration's radical assault on the post-1945 liberal international order."

In this interview, John Ross, former Director of Economic and Business Policy for the Mayor of London, and senior fellow at the Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies of Renmin University of China, shares with us his unique perspective on such a ""hybrid war,"" with the conclusion that only the Communist Party of China (CPC) can defend China against these attacks, which is the fundamental lesson of international experience of all similar attacks carried out by the US, whether against the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR), Germany, Japan or other countries."

This research uses a computer-assisted text analytical approach illustrating how an authoritarian government strategically manipulates the discourse about democracy to benefit itself. By analysing over a million political articles published in People's Daily over five decades, the study shows a refocusing framing strategy, in which the Chinese government defines democracy not with regime justification but with national policy priorities while denoting democracy most frequently alongside the fundamental values. With this strategy, the framed discourse appear to be consistent with the fundamental values in Western democracies but work for the preservation of the authoritarian regime."

Reform and Stability – The Russian and the Chinese Welfare Systems Compared.,"Kainu, Markus; Kivinen, Markku; Kuhnle, Stein; Li, Chunling",Russian Politics,Brill Academic Publishers,,China; hybrid regime; reform; Russia; social welfare; stability,"Systematic theoretical work on Russian and Chinese social policy seems to be lacking. While previous research establishes how democratic systems produce welfare, it is unclear what kind of welfare such transitional systems provide. Our analysis adheres to structuration based theoretical explanations, taking into account both agency and structure as factors needed to explain these regimes' welfare policy. Hybrid regimes are eager to adopt global liberally oriented welfare policies, which tend to ignore popular demands. Western analysis of Russian and Chinese social policy emphasizes the dualistic influence of liberal versus statist social policy. This dualistic conceptualization fails to take into account the contradictions between ideological frames and hybrid regimes' vulnerability to popular pressures. Widespread corruption undermines formal procedures and underlies growth of informal practices. Both Russia and China have considerable welfare achievements and vast problems. In conditions of economic growth, both have experienced huge increases in inequality and individualization of risk."

Influenced by the international trend of relaxing national judicial supervision, the Chinese judicial system, led by the Chinese Supreme People's Court (SPC), has promoted a series of judicial reforms to coordinate domestic arbitration and international practice. This article elaborates the SPC's recent reforms of the Chinese mechanisms of arbitration judicial supervision. The article first explores the international trend of the restraint of the national judicial supervision of arbitration. Then, the article introduces how such a trend impacts China's recent reforms of its arbitration judicial supervision. By focusing on the rules established by the SPC regarding the judicial review of both international and domestic arbitral awards, this article exposes the essential factors and corresponding solutions that hinder the efficiency of the judicial supervision of Chinese arbitration."

The present study investigates whether such bundled fiscal reforms affected one important social dimension: urban-rural income inequality. Using quasi-experimental data, the study shows that fiscal decentralization benefited only urban residents and that fiscal spending promoted income growth for both urban and rural residents, though growth velocity slowed down over time. Together, the bundled fiscal reforms saw disparate impact on urban and rural residents, with positive effects on rural income growth and negative on urban peers. The latest fiscal reforms did not enlarge urban-rural income inequality and even slowed down their growth velocity. The impact of fiscal reforms has been largely embedded into extant urban-biased institutions and questions the possible limits of state-led development policies. This study concludes by discussing policy and theoretical implications of research findings."

During this time, various competing images of who comprises the region have been seen from the narrow and geographical conception including just the ASEAN states, to wider China-preferred images based on the ASEAN plus three grouping, towards broader perspective favoured by Japan including Australia and New Zealand reflected in proposals such as the Comprehensive East Asian Economic Partnership Agreement. How do these regional competitions affect the status of Taiwan? This paper makes the argument that the move towards more state-based regional entities and patterns of engagement (regionalisation), which so far have not (yet) adversely affected Taiwan economically, it has produced significant political challenges for Taiwan's ability to continue to be autonomous from the mainland."

We study the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation's (SAARC) regime for economic integration. Based on qualitative data for 1985-2017 from key regime and policy documents and interviews, we propose the following. Besides issue-related institutional design and the resulting regime structures, the policies and policy capacities developed within a particular regime make the regime an environmental one. We analyze the environmental policy SAARC developed within the formal institutional framework between 1985 and 2017. The results show that institutional design, particularly membership and control issues, is a highly political affair, given China's ambition to join the agreement as well as the struggle between Pakistan and India for hegemony. In 2010, the SAARC Convention on Cooperation on Environment formally extended the regime's scope. The preceding environmental policy and its related capacities were fragmented and strongly built on decentralized, issue-specific environmental SAARC centers in different member states. The 2010 Convention on Cooperation on Environment streamlined this environmental policy but reduced the issue-specific policy capacities of the regime. We conclude that the formalization of environmental regimes into stronger institutional designs does not necessarily lead to stronger environmental regime policies and capacities. The proposed conceptual distinction between regime structure and regime policy will enable future regime studies to combine international relations, policy analysis, and comparative government methodologies when examining the policies of regimes and their dynamics."
"Regional inequality in urban China, allowing for spatial cost of living differences: Evidence from a hedonic analysis of apartment prices.","Li, Chao; Gibson, John; Boe‐Gibson, Geua",Asia & the Pacific Policy Studies,Wiley-Blackwell,COST & standard of living; EQUALITY; HOUSING development,China; housing; inequality; regional policy; spatial deflators,"Studies of inequality in China typically ignore cost of living differences between areas. Under the Balassa–Samuelson effect, nontradeables cost more in richer areas, so nominal inequality exceeds real inequality. This especially matters in China, where spatial cost of living differences should grow with recent development of urban housing markets. We use new data on apartment prices in 104 cities in China to develop housing‐related spatial deflators. The level of spatial inequality in urban China is overstated by 27% if cost of living differences are ignored. Our hedonic analysis of 41,000 individual apartment sales shows that most price variation is between areas, rather than from features of individual apartments. The dominant trend in the reform era is for regional inequality in China to decline, contrary to the common perceptions. In nominal terms, the Theil index for interprovincial inequality in 2016 is just 46% of its 1978 level. The current results imply that the fall in inequality in real terms would be even greater."
Regional Powers' Rise and Impact on International Conflict and Negotiation: China and India as Global and Regional Players.,"Narlikar, Amrita",Global Policy,Wiley-Blackwell,INTERNATIONAL conflict; NEGOTIATION; BELT & Road Initiative; WORLD Trade Organization; CHINA-India relations,,"In this article, I investigate the impact that the rise of regional powers as global players has had on the nature of international conflict, and also the negotiating table. I focus specifically on China and India, and analyze their negotiating behavior in two areas: one multilateral, the other regional. Despite the apparent similarities that one might assume at first glance, the article points to some significant points of difference between these two players. The differences are important from a policy perspective, besides being theoretically interesting. The argument proceeds in five parts. The first section explains the reasoning behind the case selection, with respect to the countries (China and India) as well as issue‐areas (multilateral trade governance, and the Belt and Road Initiative [BRI]). It also outlines the main hypotheses in Section 1. Section 2 investigates the two hypotheses about the negotiation behaviors of China and India in the World Trade Organization (WTO). Section 3 takes on a similar comparison with reference to the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). Section 4 presents the conclusions of the study, and Section 5 offers policy recommendations. Even if a new world order were created, to facilitate a better distribution of the gains of trade and other aspects of globalization, the entire endeavor would still be rendered futile if it did not bring the people it affects on board. To win hearts and minds will need alliance building between states, and networks within and across states."
Regulating labour dispatch in China: A cat-and-mouse game.,"Xiaojun, Feng",China Information,"Sage Publications, Ltd.",LAW enforcement; LABOR market; EMPLOYMENT,agency workers; labour dispatch; labour market regulation; new normal; outsourced workers; precarity,"This article suggests cautious optimism toward the prevailing Polanyian countermovement discourse by providing a timely and comprehensive examination of the enforcement of the labour dispatch regulation in China. Since the enactment of the regulation, some enterprises have narrowed the remuneration gap between agency workers and formal employees, while others have retained a large gap in overtime pay, bonuses, and welfare benefits between these two groups of workers. The regulation has reduced the number of agency workers, but has invoked the abuse of the more precarious 'outsourced' workers as well. The regulation has had little effect on limiting the use of agency labour to temporary, auxiliary, or substitute positions, raising the requirements of engaging in the labour dispatch business, or stabilizing the employment of agency workers. This article contributes to the extant literature on regulatory enforcement by examining the effects of non-standard employment regulation, highlighting the variance of labour law compliance among enterprises with different types of ownership, and demonstrating how China's ongoing transformation from a planned to a market economy since the 1980s and from high growth to a new normal since 2010 has fundamentally constrained the full implementation of its labour protection regulation."
Regulating membership and movement at the meso-level: citizen-making and the household registration system in East Asia.,"Chung, Erin Aeran; Draudt, Darcie; Tian, Yunchen",Citizenship Studies,Taylor & Francis Ltd,"CITIZENSHIP; COLD War, 1945-1991; POST-World War II Period; EAST Asia; MEMBERSHIP",China; Citizenship; East Asia; Japan; Korea; meso,"This paper analyzes how East Asian states have regulated membership and migration through meso-level institutions. Specifically, we examine how states have used the household registration system (China's hukou system, South Korea's hoju/hojeok system, and Japan's koseki system) in the process of nation-state building in the early post-World War Two period, as a security measure to control movement throughout the Cold War, and as a tool to build or sever trans-border kinship ties in the contemporary era. Drawing on the literature on multi-level citizenship, the article contributes to the growing scholarship that unpacks the civic-ethnic divide in comparative citizenship studies by examining how meso-level institutions shape national-level membership in countries that are commonly characterized as having 'ethnic' citizenship regimes."
Reimagining Asia: Indian and Australian women crossing borders.,"GOODALL, HEATHER; GHOSH, DEVLEENA",Modern Asian Studies,Cambridge University Press,WOMEN in politics; HISTORY; ACTIVISM; HISTORY of feminism; WOMEN'S rights; WOMEN & peace; WOMEN; INDIA; PROGRESSIVE education,,"The decades from the 1940s to the 1960s were ones of increasing contacts between women of India and Australia. These were not built on a shared British colonial history, but on commitments to visions circulating globally of equality between races, sexes, and classes. Kapila Khandvala from Bombay and Lucy Woodcock from Sydney were two women who met during such campaigns. Interacting roughly on an equal footing, they were aware of each other's activism in the Second World War and the emerging Cold War. Khandvala and Woodcock both made major contributions to the women's movements of their countries, yet have been largely forgotten in recent histories, as have links between their countries. We analyse their interactions, views, and practices on issues to which they devoted their lives: women's rights, progressive education, and peace. Their beliefs and practices on each were shaped by their respective local contexts, although they shared ideologies that were circulating internationally. These kept them in contact over many years, during which Kapila built networks that brought Australians into the sphere of Indian women's awareness, while Lucy, in addition to her continuing contacts with Kapila, travelled to China and consolidated links between Australian and Chinese women in Sydney. Their activist world was centred not in Western Europe, but in a new Asia that linked Australia and India. Our comparative study of the work and interactions of these two activist women offers strategies for working on global histories, where collaborative research and analysis is conducted in both colonizing and colonized countries."
Reinstating the Family: Intergenerational Influence on Assortative Mating in China.,"Tian, Felicia F.; Davis, Deborah S.",Chinese Sociological Review,Taylor & Francis Ltd,SOCIAL surveys; CHINA; ASSORTATIVE mating; FAMILY roles; DELTAS; FAMILIES,,"Prevailing research on assortative mating marginalizes the agency of third parties. Yet, in China, an intergenerational perspective may be useful because family members have participated in spouse selection to maintain homogamy. Using Fudan Yangtze River Delta Social Transformation Survey, we found 20 percent of young adults found their spouse through family introduction. Education reduces, while family resources increase, young people's reliance on family. For women but not men, reliance on family increased homogamy and somewhat reduced female hypogamy, particularly on ascribed characteristics. These findings suggest that family roles should be carefully analyzed to capture the search context in which marriages are created."
Rejuvenation and Global Dominance of the Chinese People through the BRI: A Confucianist Solution.,"Naseem, Ameena; Javaid, Umbreen",Journal of Political Studies,"University of the Punjab, Department of Political Science",CULTURE; INTERNATIONAL relations; CHINA; SILK Road; REJUVENATION; CHINESE; DOMINANCE (Psychology),BRI; China; Global; Rejuvenation,"China has initiated its plan to become the world's next global power and to obtain influence over other countries. China through its soft power strategy wants to be able to influence countries and people around the world. There are different means for a country like China to gain soft power and persuasive influence over other nations ways are country's political values, its foreign policy and its culture. Xi Jinping delivered speeches referencing to the ancient Silk Route in Central Asia. He launched China's multi-trillion dollar project called the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) which has two components; the economic belt and the modern day maritime Silk Road. China has also incorporated traditional aspects of Confucianism into its modern day policy to influence countries like Pakistan and gain persuasion over people."
Relating self and other in Chinese and Western thought.,"Nordin, Astrid H. M.; Smith, Graham M.",Cambridge Review of International Affairs,Taylor & Francis Ltd,MALE domination (Social structure); COLONIES; OTHER (Philosophy); ENGLISH-speaking countries; TYPOLOGY (Theology),,"Recent debates in international relations seek to decolonize the discipline by focusing on relationality between self and other. This article examines the possibilities for preserving a particular type of otherness: 'radical otherness' or 'alterity'. Such otherness can provide a bulwark against domination and colonialism: there is always something truly other which cannot be assimilated. However, two problems arise. First, if otherness is truly inaccessible, how can self relate to it? Does otherness undermine relationality? Second, can we talk about otherness without making it the same? Is the very naming of otherness a new form of domination? This article draws out and explores the possibilities for radical otherness in sinophone and anglophone relational theorizing. It addresses the difficulties presented by the need for a sense of radical otherness, on the one hand, and the seeming impossibility of either detecting it or relating to it, on the other. By constructing a typology of four accounts of otherness, it finds that the identification and preservation of radical otherness poses significant problems for relationality. Radical otherness makes relationality between self and other impossible, but without radical otherness there is a danger of domination and assimilation. This is common to both sinophone and anglophone endeavours."
Relational ontology and the politics of boundary-making: East Asian financial regionalism.,"Lee, Yong Wook",Politics,Sage Publications Inc.,REGIONALISM; EMPIRICAL research; EAST Asia; ONTOLOGY; RATIONALIZATION (Sociology),ASEAN Plus Three; boundary-making; collective identity; East Asian financial regionalism; relational ontology,"In this article, I seek to demonstrate the analytical utility and value-added of 'relational ontology' for studying region-making and regional institutional developments. Relational ontology stands in sharp contrast to the dominant individualistic ontology found in mainstream theories of regionalism. I make the case theoretically and empirically that relational ontology offers a better analytical fit with the investigation of regionalism. Analytically, the crux of relational ontology is the notion that the structure of identity and interests emerges and develops relationally in the process of one's making contact with and subsequently marking boundary with others in relevant contexts. More concretely, I develop a three-stage analytics of boundary-making. The analytical framework proposes three sequential stages of 'proto-boundary', 'yoking', and 'rationalization' towards the making of a boundary that creates 'inside' by defining 'outside'. This boundary-making practice is empirically observable in the politics of membership when regional institutional buildings occur. I illustrate the validity of the relational analytical framework with a case of the exclusive East Asian financial regionalism. My empirical focus is on the institutional development of the Chiang Mai Initiative (the CMI/CMIM (Chiang Mai Initiative Multilateralization)) over the past 15 years, a regional financial safety net in East Asia. In terms of membership, the ASEAN plus Three (China, Japan, and Korea) developed it while excluding the United States from membership."

The point of reference for the presented analysis is the foreign policy of the former President Barack Obama, based on the strategy known as ""pivot to Asia"" – the strategic turnabout of the United States to the Asia-Pacific region. One of its main objectives was the signing of a multilateral agreement on the establishment of a free trade zone, the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), bringing together 12 countries. The main subject of the present analysis is to examine the impact of Donald Trump's decision of January 2017 to withdraw from the TPP trade agreement on the relations between the remaining signatories of the agreement, as well as to examine Beijing's actions, which may seek to increase its sphere of influence in Asia through the breakdown of TPP. The main part of the research is focused on the triangle politics concept in international politics, which will include China, Singapore and the United States. Besides the two largest economic powers, Singapore is included because of its membership in the TPP and ASEAN, and due to its strong economy and its population (predominantly) of Chinese origin it can be viewed as the ""fifth column"" or may otherwise play a role in the Greater China concept."

Religious liberty for the Chinese child: missionary debates in the 1930s.,"TILLMAN, Margaret Mih",Journal of Modern Chinese History,Taylor & Francis Ltd,,childhood; China; Christianity; Frank Rawlinson; mission field; Religious education,"In 1931, liberal and conservative Christians debated the possibility of replacing Bible Study with a comparative religions course for elementary-school students, in order to comply with regulations of the Republic of China. Made possible by the ecumenical and indigenization movements within Christianity, this debate intersected with multiple issues: Western accommodation to the rise of Chinese nationalism; Christian resistance to growing secularization in the West, including elements of the social gospel; and clerical responses to child-centered pedagogies. Furthermore, liberals also promoted religious studies as a method for increasing cross-cultural understanding and world peace after World War II. While previous scholars have situated government registration of parochial schools within the rise of Chinese nationalism, this article asserts that missionaries in the 1930s viewed children's religious education within the framework of both Chinese indigenization and global secularization."

The recently published volume Stereotyping Religion : Critiquing Clichés (2017) tackles several of these and shows why scholars find them to be clichéd. By describing their origins and elucidating the social or political work they rhetorically accomplish in the present, the authors of the volume address some important clichés, namely, that religions are belief systems, that religion is a private matter or that it exclusively concerns the transcendent. In the same way, scholars of religion in the Chinese speaking world find themselves often having to dispel the many myths that surround it. Does China have religion? What does it look like? And where does it stand vis-à-vis religious tolerance? In this short article, I take a comparative look at the late imperial period in China and the substantive changes that took place at the end of it. What does religious tolerance – and its opposite – mean in the context of China's modern epistemic order?"
Reluctant allies: system-unit dynamics and China-Russia relations.,"Korolev, Alexander; Portyakov, Vladimir",International Relations,"Sage Publications, Ltd.",INTERNATIONAL relations; CHINA-Russia relations; ECONOMIC models,China-Russia relations; foreign policy; neoclassical realism,"This article attempts to advance the neoclassical realist framework by elaborating on the interaction between system-level and unit-level factors in the formation of states' behavior. With an empirical focus on post-Cold War China–Russia relations, which represent the ambivalent combination of a consistently growing strategic entente and a simultaneous reluctance to form a full-fledged political-military alliance, this study establishes two major unit-level factors – differing economic models and negative historical memories – that create hurdles for alliance formation between the two countries. However, under greater systemic pressure from the US-led unipolarity, China's and Russia's state leaders have not only increased bilateral military-to-military cooperation but have begun to actively implement policies to deliberately transform, if not remove, the existing non-systemic hurdles. Therefore, the neoclassical realist framework can be understood and further tested as a dynamic interaction model in which the unit-level circumstances, while moderating the causal impact of the system, are themselves being transformed by the system via state policies, as is their impact on states' foreign policy."

Commonly considered a breakpoint marking the end of the dynasty's golden age spanning most of the eighteenth century, the war to suppress the rebels, referred to as the White Lotus War (1796–1804) in this article ('White Lotus' was the umbrella name used by both the authorities and some sectarians for their teaching), exposed many structural drawbacks of the Qing political and military systems and depleted the dynasty's financial resources, which had never been recovered. Reluctant in embracing guerrilla warfare in the beginning, the insurgents quickly turned themselves into master guerrillas. Shuttling in two massive mountain ranges in central China, they managed to prolong their rebellion and fought some successful battles against their suppressors. Superior in manpower, weaponry, and logistical support, the government forces had to adapt to guerrilla warfare, albeit passively and ineptly. This article gives a brief introduction to this little-known episode of guerrilla war at the turn of the nineteenth century in Qing China, expounds the strengths and weaknesses of both sides, and sheds light on the roots of the war's long duration and the grim consequences to the Qing state."

The People's Republic has become powerful in ways that probably would have astonished the leaders of the early Republic of China, first established in 1911. These changes do not mean, however, that there are not potent legacies from China's nineteenth-century and Versailles-era experiences. In particular, the Versailles agreement showed China that gaining full membership of the international society of states would not be easy, despite its having joined the Allied side in the war effort. China's failure to gain either restitution of the territory of Shandong or proper acknowledgement of its status as a legally sovereign state added to the Chinese distrust of the West and Japan born out of their exploitative activities in China. The subsequent May Fourth nationalist demonstration of 1919 was the first of many prominent displays of nationalist outrage, a sentiment that provided opportunities for exploitation by successive Chinese governments. The article shows how the trials associated with removing China's unequal status in international politics condition and, in some respects, deform Chinese attitudes towards international politics to this day. In particular, it asks why China's remarkable resurgence has not changed official Chinese perceptions of world order, the tenor of its relations with other states and its view of its own place in international society more fundamentally than has in fact been the case."
Renegotiating pariah state partnerships: Why Myanmar and North Korea respond differently to Chinese influence.,"Chow, Jonathan T.; Easley, Leif-Eric",Contemporary Security Policy,Taylor & Francis Ltd,SANCTIONS (International law); INTERNATIONAL relations; OLYMPIC Winter Games,authoritarian regime transitions; China foreign relations; economic and security reliance; Myanmar politics; North Korea nuclear weapons; pariah states,"Pariah status for violating international norms over decades increased Myanmar and North Korea's dependence on China. Myanmar's post-2010 reforms sought to reduce international sanctions and diversify diplomatic relations. North Korea pursued a diplomatic offensive after the 2018 Winter Olympics, but only after declaring itself a nuclear state. Why, despite both states' politically unsustainable dependence on China, did Myanmar and North Korea pursue different strategies for renegotiating reliance? Unlike the Kim regime, Myanmar's junta could step back from power while protecting its interests. Pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi was a credible signaler of reforms, providing Western governments political cover to reduce sanctions. Myanmar used liberalizing reforms to address internal threats, whereas North Korea utilizes external threats for regime legitimacy. The theoretical underpinnings and empirical trajectories of these distinctions–as well as Myanmar's backsliding on human rights–explain why reducing reliance on China may prove more difficult than shedding pariah status."

I examine how leaders of the next generation of English‐speaking Chinese Canadian evangelicals made sense of their participation in the Chinese Coordination Centre of World Evangelism, a movement that rallies behind both a pan‐Chinese identity and the belief that the Chinese have a special role in evangelizing the world. I argue that the call to religious mobilization grounded in Chinese ethnicity stands on tenuous ground and propose that linguistic, geographical, generational and ideological fractures may diminish the participation of future generations of the Chinese diaspora in ethnically‐based transnational religious organizations. I conclude that these developments would push 'negotiated transnational religious networks' into a state of 'renegotiation'."

We argue that the word ""representation"" in English and ""dàibiǎo 代表"" in Chinese are not interchangeable synonymous, because ""representation"" includes a symbolic dimension that is absent in dàibiǎo, and because the latter is rarely used when informal representation is concerned. We also argue that both Chinese and Anglo-American political science research overemphasizes mandated representation and underestimates symbolic representation. Furthermore, our empirical research in three provinces of China and two regions of France demonstrates that in both countries, local officials and elected politicians serve a similar role of political intermediaries, who embody state power and respond to citizens' demands simultaneously, thus enabling a de-facto representative loop. Such argument refutes the current understanding of representation as a ""one-way authorization"" that is supposed to come either from below (i.e. from the people) in the electoral democracies or from above (i.e. from the state authority) in authoritarian regimes and thus challenges the over-simplistic dichotomy of democratic and authoritarian regimes in representative studies."
Representation in a context across political orders and the Chinese case.,"Heberer, Thomas",Journal of Chinese Governance,Taylor & Francis Ltd,REPRESENTATIVE government; ELECTIONS; CITIZENS; CHINA; LITERATURE,authoritarian states; digital representation; informal and symbolic representation; Political representation,"This paper sheds light on the issue of political representation in an authoritarian context, taking China as a case study. In the academic literature, the concept of political representation is primarily related to mechanisms of representation in a democratic setting, used in a rather technical or normative sense and concerned with institutionalized representation in legislatures and parliaments, with a strong focus on elections by which citizens express their political will. The conviction prevails that only persons elected in a competitive electoral procedure can be conceived as legitimate representatives. Widely lacking in the scholarly literature are approaches which explain the nature of political representation in a non-democratic setting. To date, patterns of formal and informal representation in an authoritarian context constitute a 'black hole' in the literature on representation. This article tries to answer two research questions: (1) How does representation in an authoritarian system work? (2) What can we conclude from the Chinese case with regard to representation in an authoritarian setting? The article first conceptualizes representation in an authoritarian setting. Second, it examines which mechanisms of representation and representative claims exist in China. Third, it distinguishes between five mechanisms of political representation: formal, informal, symbolic, traditional and digital. It is argued that informal patterns of representation are crucial since formal ones are more strictly controlled. A new and specific role is played by 'digital representation': a vigorous form of representation via the cyberspace, spawning new and innovative modes of formal, informal and symbolic political representation. In the conclusions, the author considers what his findings regarding the Chinese case mean for the concept of representation in authoritarian states. He also explains why representation in an autocratic context can produce political output and exhibit legitimacy among the represented."
"Representation, legitimacy, and innovation.","Mansbridge, Jane",Journal of Chinese Governance,Taylor & Francis Ltd,DURESS (Law); DEFECTORS; FREE-rider problem; CORRUPTION; ECOLOGICAL niche,Crisis; free-rider problems; legitimacy; recursive representation; representative system; state coercion,"Increasing interdependence both within and among nations will create in the foreseeable future increasing numbers of collective action, or free-rider, problems. Dealing with those problems will require both significant increases in state coercion and increases in citizens' feelings of solidarity and duty toward others both within current nations and across large geographic areas. State coercion of defectors provides an ecological niche within which the duty and solidarity of cooperators can survive and thrive. Considerable thought and ingenuity are required to make the needed coercion minimal, well-designed so as to protect rather than driving out duty and solidarity, and above all legitimate. Innovations in the representative system are and will be crucial to making the state coercion we need more legitimate. This paper lists some innovations in thought and practice that can make representation in the legislative, administrative, and societal realms more legitimate, both normatively and in the perception of the citizens. These include mixed member electoral systems, new conceptions of the representative role, new approaches to corruption, evolutions in the theory and institutions that protect human rights, and better conceptions of and practical attention to deliberation, legislative negotiation, recursive communication, descriptive representation, representation by lot, participatory budgeting, and civic vouchers."
Research Viewpoint: International Relations and the Second Space Race Between the United States and China.,"Hickman, John",Astropolitics,Taylor & Francis Ltd,INTERNATIONAL relations; INTERNATIONAL relations theory; INTERNATIONAL cooperation; BALANCE of power; INTERNATIONALISM; CHINA; UNITED States,,"How do the three major schools of international relations theory – liberal internationalism, realism, and constructivism – account for the second space race, the rivalry between China and the United States to scientifically explore and economically develop the Moon? This article assesses answers drawn from these three schools of international relations. Rather than distance from the Earth, surface area, and resource endowment, it is the lack of native population and status as a commons in international law that make the Moon a novel object of international relations. From the perspectives of both liberal internationalism and constructivism, the Sino-American rivalry represents failure. International institutions and organizations, which were established to extend the liberal world order into outer space, failed in this case to restrain the behavior of China and the United States. The diplomatic communication between Chinese and American national decision-makers failed to draw them into adherence with the norm of international cooperation encoded in those international institutions and organizations. By contrast, realism accounts for the second space race as an example of balancing of power. National decision-makers ignored international institutions and organizations together with international norms to gain or not lose relative international prestige, business opportunity, and potential economic growth."
Research Viewpoint: Rapid Growth of the Chinese Commercial Space Sector.,"Yuan, Yuan; Peeters, W.",Astropolitics,Taylor & Francis Ltd,EXPORT controls; INTERNATIONAL cooperation; GOVERNMENT aid; CHINA; SPACE; CHINESE,,"There is a natural process that major technological activities are in a first stage supported by governments and later evolve into commercial and private activities. Space activities are a present example of this and this process is now also taking place in China. One of the prerequisites to commercial activities is flexibility in regulations, particularly export controls and technology transfer. The Chinese government is accelerating the adaption of regulations to facilitate the growth of the Chinese commercial space sector. An overview of this process, including the status and listing of the present regulations, is given in this paper. The success of this process is demonstrated by recent commercial space activities in China illustrating that there is a trend towards promoting such activities supported by the government. This paper conducts research and discussion on the Chinese space sector and its international cooperation in the field of legal implications, governance, and cooperation. It provides an understanding of evolving Chinese space regulations and the growth of present Chinese commercial space activities."
Resetting the South Korea--China Relationship: The THAAD Controversies and Their Aftermath.,Sukhee Han,Korean Journal of Defense Analysis,Korea Institute for Defense Analyses,,economic retaliation; post--THAAD; South Korea--China relations; THAAD controversy; Victory Day,"Despite 25 years of unprecedentedly friendly ties between South Korea and China, the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) disputes and China's ensuing sanctions against South Korea have forced the bilateral relationship into an unprecedented standoff. Given South Korea's growing dependence on China in economic and North Korean affairs, commentators always assumed that the South Korean government would ""manage"" this relationship. China has maintained a close relationship to keep South Korea within its orbit, restraining Seoul from further efforts to strengthen the U.S.--South Korean alliance. However, the Park Geun-hye government's decision to respond to North Korea's incessant provocations by deploying the THAAD system in South Korea caused China to implement economic retaliation. The ensuing paralysis of bilateral relations has lasted for over a year. A key problem for the future of the bilateral relationship is the fact that both countries have lost trust in each other. China views South Korea's decision to deploy THAAD as a betrayal of its support, while South Korea objects to China's relentless economic bullying. Consequently, post--THAAD South Korea-- China relations are likely to reflect South Korea's efforts to reduce its dependency on China and to manage its development in a more balanced way."
Resistant to Change? The EU as a Normative Power and Its Troubled Relations with Russia and China.,"Michalski, Anna; Nilsson, Niklas",Foreign Policy Analysis,Oxford University Press / USA,INTERNATIONAL relations; EUROPEAN Union; CHINA-Russia relations; BUSINESS partnerships; DIPLOMATICS,,"In this article, we investigate the European Union's (EU) role as a normative foreign policy actor and its troubled relations to Russia and China. We contend that the lack of preparedness of the EU to foresee the increasingly tense relations with these countries can be explained through a role theoretical perspective. We show that the attachment of the EU to its role as a normative international actor reduced its awareness of Russia's and China's growing refusal to accept the EU's ambition to diffuse liberal norms and principles. The EU's inability to read the changing role expectations of China and Russia hampered the shaping of an appropriate foreign policy leading up the diplomatic crises with these two countries in the late 2000s and early 2010s, respectively. Theoretically, the findings contribute with a novel understanding of role conceptions in terms of reducing an actor's preparedness to acknowledge changes to its international role position caused by challenges raised by antagonistic partners."
Resolving the Misunderstood Historical Order: A Korean Perspective on the Historical Tributary Order in East Asia.,"Oh, Si Jin",Journal of the History of International Law,Brill Academic Publishers,FEUDALISM; SOVEREIGNTY; INTERNATIONAL law; HISTORIANS; SCHOLARS,East Asia; history of international law; Korea; legal pluralism; suzerain; tribute; vassal,"Regarding the historical East Asian order, previous studies appear to have emphasized Chinese and Japanese perspectives, and this academic phenomenon seems to have contributed to solidifying a misunderstanding. This study attempts to present a Korean perspective providing different points of view that challenge previous perspectives on the legal status of Korea in the nineteenth century. One of the critical misunderstandings about the historical relationship between China and Korea is that of vassalage. However, such an analogy is misleading. The East Asian international normative order, which was based on Li , is a particular order that requires a separate treatment. The nature of the tributary order would not necessarily impair sovereignty if it were possible to project and apply the classical international law of the nineteenth century. As the policy of Dongdoseogi represents, however, Korea once seemed to have preferred to maintain the two normative systems simultaneously."

Responsive or Repressive? How Frontline Bureaucrats Enforce the One Child Policy in China.,"Mattingly, Daniel C.",Comparative Politics,Political Science Program,"ONE-child policy, China; SOCIAL conditions in China",,"Frontline Bureaucrats Enforce the One Child Policy in China How do authoritarian states implement policies that curb individual freedom? In this article, I examine the implementation of the One Child Policy in China, which has had an enormous impact on Chinese society and yet has received little attention from political scientists. I argue that the success or failure of the policy hinged on using frontline bureaucrats to infilltrate society. Important theories suggest that bureaucratic penetration may increase bureaucrats' responsiveness to citizens and decrease implementation of the law. Drawing on a unique dataset and natural experiment, I show the opposite to be true in China: a one standard deviation increase in bureaucratic penetration lowers over-quota births by 2 to 7 percentage points. There is suggestive evidence that bureaucrats leverage their social embeddedness to control society. The article shows how frontline bureaucrats beyond the police, military, or ruling party are key agents of repression and political control."
Re-theorizing civil society in China: Agency and the discursive politics of civil society engagement.,"Gleiss, Marielle Stigum; Sæther, Elin; Fürst, Kathinka",China Information,"Sage Publications, Ltd.",CIVIL society; EMPIRICAL research; SOCIAL groups,advocacy; discourse; identity; non-governmental organizations (NGOs); politics; representation,"Scholarship on Chinese civil society has produced rich empirical studies, but there have been few attempts to theorize the empirical knowledge acquired. Moreover, the question of how to conceptualize the political agency of civil society in a non-democratic context has received limited systematic attention. In this conceptual article, we draw on a discursive approach to politics to analyse the political agency of Chinese civil society. Our analysis is based on synthesizing insights gained through three separate research projects. We propose a conceptual framework which focuses on how civil society actors position themselves within a structured political space, how they represent social groups and issues through advocacy, how they care for these groups, and how they engage in processes of identity formation. Taken together, these four modalities constitute a framework for analysing the different political dimensions of civil society agency."
Rethinking Democratic Diffusion: Bringing Regime Type Back In.,"Goldring, Edward; Greitens, Sheena Chestnut",Comparative Political Studies,Sage Publications Inc.,POLITICAL systems; DEMOCRATIZATION; REGIME change; CHINA; DIFFUSION; SIMILARITY (Psychology),China; democratization and regime change; nondemocratic regimes; political regimes,"Studies of democratic diffusion often emphasize geographic proximity: democratization in a country or region makes democratization nearby more likely. We argue that regime type has been underappreciated; authoritarian breakdown and democratization often diffuse along networks of similar regimes. A regime's type affects its vulnerability to popular challenge, and regime similarity increases the likelihood that protest strategies developed against one regime are effective against similar regimes. We employ a qualitative case study from China to generate our theory, then test it quantitatively and with out-of-sample cases. We find that regime similarity strongly predicts autocratic breakdown and democratic diffusion, making both outcomes more likely. Including regime similarity significantly reduces the effect of geographic proximity, although geographic proximity may increase the effect of regime similarity. Reinterpreting democratic diffusion as a regime-type phenomenon calls for revision to conventional wisdom on the role of international factors in authoritarian breakdown and democratization."
Rethinking Representation: Representative Claims in Global Perspective.,"Guasti, Petra; Geissel, Brigitte",Politics & Governance,Cogitatio Press,REPRESENTATIVE government; CLAIMS; EMPIRICAL research; WESTERN countries,constructivist turn; democracy; representation; representative claim,"The established notion of political representation is challenged on multiple accounts-theoretically, conceptually, and empirically. The contributions to this thematic issue explore the constructivist turn as the means for rethinking political representation today around the world. The articles included here seek to reconsider representation by theoretically and empirically reassessing how representation is conceptualized, claimed and performed-in Western and non-Western contexts. In recognition that democratic representation in Western countries is in a process of fundamental transformation and that non-Western countries no longer aim at replicating established Western models, we look for representation around the world-specifically in: Belgium, Brazil, France, Germany, China, and India. This enables us to advance the study of representative democracy from a global perspective. We show the limits and gaps in the constructivist literature and the benefits of theory-driven empirical research. Finally, we provide conceptual tools and frameworks for the (comparative) study of claims of representation."

Retire in Peace: Officials' Political Incentives and Corporate Diversification in China.,"Wang, Danqing; Luo, Xiaowei Rose",Administrative Science Quarterly,Administrative Science Quarterly,STATE government personnel; ORGANIZATIONAL behavior; SOCIAL stability; ECONOMIC development; GOVERNMENT business enterprises; DIVERSIFICATION in industry; PUBLIC companies; CHINA,diversification in Chinese firms; market transition; political economy,"We develop a theory of how state officials' political incentives can affect corporate behavior. In the pursuit of multiple goals, such as social stability and economic development, the state designs criteria to evaluate its officials' performance. Those officials may be motivated to prioritize different goals at different stages of their careers and to mobilize firms to help them achieve those goals. We test our theory in the context of Chinese publicly listed firms' diversification between 2001 and 2011, when the state faced economic and social ramifications of bankrupt state-owned enterprises (SOEs) laying off large numbers of workers. Our results show that when large layoffs occurred, some firms diversified into industries unrelated to their core business by acquiring bankrupt SOEs and reemploying their workers. This was more likely to occur when the governor of the firm's home province was closer to retirement, as social stability was more important than economic development for the retiring governor's career objective. The effect of career stage was weaker for Communist Party leaders, who more consistently prioritized social stability, and when a provincial state experienced intense collective actions that made social stability a stronger immediate focus. The effect was strengthened for firms more vulnerable to officials' influence, such as those with a strong socialist imprint and those dependent on government resources. Our study extends the Weberian state literature and the political economy research on incentives, and it offers a political explanation for corporate diversification in a major transitional economy."
"Retrenchment as a Screening Mechanism: Power Shifts, Strategic Withdrawal, and Credible Signals.","Yoder, Brandon K.","American Journal of Political Science (John Wiley & Sons, Inc.)","John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",POWER (Social sciences); INTERNATIONAL relations; REGIONALISM (International organization); POLITICAL science; PRACTICAL politics; DOWNSIZING of organizations; CHINA-United States relations,,"Both advocates and opponents of retrenchment have treated it as an undesirable, last‐ditch strategy for states that have already experienced severe decline. This article presents a formal model that identifies an unrecognized benefit of retrenchment: It can provide declining states with valuable information about rising states' future intentions. By removing constraints over the behavior of rising states in a particular region, a declining state can induce hostile risers to attempt revision of the regional order. This, in turn, makes a riser's cooperative behavior more credible as a signal of benign intentions, allowing the decliner to oppose hostile types while accommodating benign ones. In contrast to the existing focus on retrenchment as a desperate strategy taken from a position of weakness, this article suggests that the informational benefits of retrenchment are greatest when it is undertaken early, from a position of strength."
Reversing China's Belt-and-Road Initiative—Singapore's Response to the BRI and Its Quest for Relevance.,"Chan, Irene",East Asia: An International Quarterly,Springer Nature,BELT & Road Initiative; SINGAPORE; CONSTRUCTION projects; INVESTMENTS; CHINA -- Foreign relations,Belt-and-Road Initiative; China; Legitimacy; Political; Relevance; Reverse BRI flow; Singapore,"The article seeks to explain why Singapore—a high-income, developed economy that does not require massive external financing or technical assistance for domestic infrastructure building—has repeatedly endorsed Belt-and-Road Initiative (BRI) and cooperated in related projects. Given the city-state's exceptionally high degree of economic openness and hence dependence on international trade, it argues that Singapore's support for BRI is driven primarily by its quest for strategic relevance. Lacking natural resources and an economic hinterland, the small trading state has pursued state-guided development, establishing itself as a key regional and global trading hub. Singapore's economic goals thus correspond to BRI's objective of improving Eurasian connectivity and strengthening trade and investment ties. At the same time, however, the city-state is also pursuing a hedging strategy vis-à-vis China. Singapore seeks to ensure no one major power dictates the economic terms in the region. The city-state hence seeks to both socialize Beijing in the norms of the existing regional architecture through engagement, while also emphasizing economic relations with other countries, especially the USA. Unlike most of China's other BRI partners, Singapore is not a recipient of investments, but rather a case of ""reverse BRI flow"": Singapore is investing in the development of China's western region, especially Chongqing. Singapore's support for BRI is likely to continue, even though the state may encounter obstacles along the way, such as the need to manage the effects of growing Sino-US rivalry."

Revision of Japan's Foreign Policy After Donald Trump's Electoral Victory.,"Żakowski, Karol",International Studies: Interdisciplinary Political & Cultural Journal,Sciendo,"INTERNATIONAL relations; JAPAN; UNITED States; TRUMP, Donald, 1946-; ABE, Shinzo, 1954-",Donald Trump; foreign policy; Japan; Japan–US relations,"The article analyzes the process of modification of Japan's foreign policy after Donald Trump's election as US president. As short- and middle-range aims of Japan's diplomatic strategy were outlined with expectation of victory of Hillary Clinton, Tokyo was forced to abruptly change its policy. Relying on the neoclassical realist theory, the article examines the complex interaction between the external factors, such as security threats from North Korea or China, and domestic factors both in Japan and the US, that is personal, institutional, societal and economic determinants. It is argued that while it was strategic convergence between Tokyo and Washington that enabled relatively smooth cooperation between Prime Minister Abe and President Trump, internal factors, such as right-wing credentials of both decision makers, distorted and to some extent facilitated this process."

"Revisiting multi-level governance theory: Politics and innovation in the urban climate transition in Rizhao, China.","Westman, Linda Katrin; Castán Broto, Vanesa; Huang, Ping",Political Geography,Elsevier B.V.,MULTI-level governance (Theory); METROPOLITAN government; POLITICAL agenda; POLITICAL systems; CHINA; URBAN climatology; CARBON nanofibers,China; Cities; Climate change; Multi-level governance; Politics,"Multi-level governance (MLG) theory has become the main explanation for how climate action is realized in polycentric, multi-sector, multi-actor policy landscapes. In this paper, we examine processes of climate change governance in a given city in China, Rizhao, and evaluate how MLG arrangements operate. We do so by examining primary data collected through in-depth interviews with local stakeholders. Our results show that the focus on multi-level – and in particular transnational – interactions obscures the ways in which urban low carbon transitions happen in three ways. First, in spite of Rizhao being a well-known case in environmental politics, there is an absence of international actors and non-governmental organizations operating on the ground. Second, the emphasis on opportunities of local authorities to build political agendas through participation in global networks conceals how structures of power, political-economic coalitions, and technological practices are firmly fixed in a local context. Third, the case study illustrates the enduring authority of formal top-down channels of control in this political system. Based on these results, we caution against the uncritical application of MLG theory to environmental politics in settings where deliberative democracy is lacking and the full benefits of multi-level interactions are unlikely to be achieved."

Other contributing factors were the Malayan government's willingness to negotiate, the Communists' military difficulties, and the Communist International's stance of peaceful coexistence. Baling's failure marked the end of this phase of China's rapprochement and a reversion to supporting armed struggle until relations thawed again in the early 1970s."
Revolution and world order: the case of the Islamic State (ISIS).,"Vu, Tuong; Van Orden, Patrick",International Politics,Palgrave Macmillan Ltd.,INTERNATIONAL cooperation; REVOLUTIONS; ISLAMIC State (Organization),Communism; Islamic State; Islamism; Revolution; World order,"Scholars have studied revolutions mostly as domestic events while neglecting their transnational character. From the French to the Chinese Revolution, revolutionary ideologies and networks have never been confined to national boundaries. As transnational events, revolutions can create ruptures in global politics and challenge world order. Some young revolutionary states have perished. Others such as Iran have endured, but tensions persist. Given the importance of the topic, the literature is surprisingly limited. We propose a theoretical framework that explains the evolution of the relationship between anti-Western revolutionary states and the global order and apply it to the case of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS). Our framework explains why some revolutionary states are accommodated or tolerated, whereas others are opposed, isolated, and destroyed. Using the Islamic State to illustrate our framework, we explain the main reason for the demise of the Islamic State (ISIS): its own radicalism."
Revolutionary Origins of Political Regimes and Trajectories of Popular Mobilization in the Late Communist Period.,"Vladisavljević, Nebojša",Nationalities Papers,Cambridge University Press,DEMONSTRATIONS (Collective behavior); NATIONALISM; POLARIZATION (Social sciences); COMMUNISM; YUGOSLAVIA -- Politics & government; POLAND -- Politics & government; CHINA -- Politics & government; SOVIET Union -- Politics & government,authoritarianism; China; Poland; political regimes; popular protest; revolutionary legacies; the Soviet Union; Yugoslavia,"Popular protest, which repeatedly occurred in Communist regimes, turned into massive mobilizational waves in the late Communist period. Why did some protests result in state cooptation and particularist nationalism (Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union), and others in state-society polarization (Poland) and protest containment (China), when these states shared important historical, political, and institutional legacies? Political regimes with origins in indigenous popularly-based revolutionary movements are more resilient to popular protests and other major crises than other authoritarian regimes. Protracted ideological armed struggle largely overlaps with broader patriotic causes, such as liberation wars or struggles against foreign intervention. The revolutionary regimes thus acquire patriotic credentials, while boundaries between partisan and patriotic identities become blurred, which strengthens their elite unity and popular base. Popular protests thus facilitate a complex political game of old and new actors that may result in regime survival or transformation. In other regimes, popular unrest tends to produce state-society polarization and, ultimately, regime delegitimation and breakdown. Popular contention in complex multinational institutional settings, if there is no major external threat, highlights old and triggers new conflicts along these structural and institutional divides and, where dual political identities prevail, facilitates identity shifts in particularist direction."
Rhetorical Legitimation of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank: Evidence from Chinese State Media.,"Yang, Hai; Keukeleire, Stephan",Journal of Contemporary China,Taylor & Francis Ltd,MASS media; ORGANIZATIONAL legitimacy; COMPLEMENTARITY (International law); ASIAN Infrastructure Investment Bank; BANKING industry; MEMBERSHIP,,"This research examines throughout the rhetorical efforts of Chinese state media to externally legitimate the AIIB. To that end, it builds an analytical framework of legitimacy comprising four general dimensions—external, institutional, procedural and performance, each of which is substantiated by legitimacy claims specific to the AIIB. Empirically, the article is based on an in-depth content analysis of 730 AIIB-centric articles collected from four state media. The study finds the following: (1) Chinese state media grounded the AIIB's justificatory rhetoric primarily on institutional legitimacy and external recognition, and more specifically, the bank's utility, complementarity, and growing membership/support; (2) Chinese state media intensified rhetorical efforts following the UK's announcement to join and increasing international attention on the new bank. The framework built and conclusions drawn herein can shed some light on China's rhetorical legitimation of its emerging institution-building behavior."
Rhetorical traps and China's peaceful rise: Malaysia and the Philippines in the South China Sea territorial disputes.,"Lai, Christina J",International Relations of the Asia-Pacific,Oxford University Press / USA,COMPARATIVE studies; SOUTH China Sea; CHINA -- Foreign relations; MARITIME boundaries; CHINA-United States relations,,"China's economy and its military capabilities have grown significantly in the last three decades, yet Southeast Asian countries responded differently to China's foreign policy. This article examines China's assurance and reassurance strategy toward Malaysia and the Philippines in the South China Sea territorial disputes. It points outs the 'assurance and entrapment' strategy that China and its neighbors deployed toward each other. China deploys different foreign discourses toward these two countries to address their concerns, and these countries also positively respond to Chinese rhetoric. However, when China was more assertive during 2010–13, they applied rhetorical strategies to constrain China's foreign behavior. Specifically, both Malaysia and the Philippines set up different traps to gauge China's intentions and highlight the inconsistency between China's previous commitment on the peaceful rise and its recent assertiveness. The comparative analysis shows how they employ legitimation strategy in the territorial disputes. It concludes with policy implications for US–China relations."
Ricardian Equivalence: Empirical Evidences From China.,"Banday, Umer Jeelanie; Aneja, Ranjan",Asian Affairs: An American Review,Taylor & Francis Ltd,COINTEGRATION; BUDGET deficits; RICARDIAN equivalence theorem; ECONOMIC conditions in China,budget deficit; China; cointegration; Ricardian equivalence,"This article provides an empirical approach to analyze the validity of the Ricardian equivalence (RE) theorem for China using time series data over the period 1990 to 2016. The results reveal that private consumption (c) has a long run relationship with tax (T), budget deficit (d), real interest rate (r), and government spending (G2). The empirical results exhibit that the coefficients of T, r, and d are negative and statistically significant which means that an increase in any of variable will reduce private consumption. The proposition of RE theorem holds that it is insignificant if budget deficit is financed by tax increase or debt issue, since under specific conditions, the impact of government consumption on total demand remains orthogonal to the method of financing budget deficit because rational economic agents consider todays deficit financing as tomorrows tax liabilities. The results of multicointegration estimation and rational expectations model invalidates the RE theorem in China. The rejection of the RE theorem for China is due to liquidity constraint, uncertainty which offsets consumption, and finite time horizons which invalidate the RE theorem."
Right target; wrong tactics: the trump administration upends East Asian order.,"Pempel, T.

Numerous countries share such concerns about China. Yet the Trump administration's approach is wrong for at least three big reasons. First, tariffs avoid addressing the most fundamental complaints about China while they undermine the longstanding and beneficial global liberal trade order. Second, the U.S. approach has been unilateral rather than multilateral, weakening America's bargaining position while alienating close allies. Third, the Trump administration escalates what is an economic challenge into an existential threat, ignoring numerous benefits from Chinese policies as well as ignoring multiple areas where China has been a powerful global partner. Middle powers in Asia have acted collectively and individually to bolster the global trading system and avoid the worst consequences of the Trump actions while seeking to avoid making permanent binary choices between the United States and China. Beyond the immediate problems, the Trump tariff wars are creating, they also generate damaging second order effects that are undermining domestic and regional policies conducive to enhanced American strengths and an economically less mercantilist China."
Rising Powers and Grassroots Image Management: Confucius Institutes and China in the Media.,"Brazys, Samuel; Dukalskis, Alexander",Chinese Journal of International Politics,Oxford University Press / USA,INTERNATIONAL relations; BALANCE of power; GRASSROOTS movements; CHINA; KONGZI xue yuan; IMAGE,,"This article proposes and tests a mechanism of grassroots image management to explain how rising powers craft an international environment more conducive to their interests. The aim is to promote the state's foreign policy goals by influencing the perceptions of ordinary foreign citizens. To test this mechanism, we examine the impact of China's Confucius Institutes (CIs) as an observable instrument of China's grassroots image management strategy. Using data from the Global Database of Events, Language, and Tone (GDELT), we employ a spatial–temporal approach which finds that proximity to an active CI significantly and substantively improves the tone of media reporting about events relevant to China in that locality. The finding is robust to different specifications and estimation strategies, and is qualitatively consistent with results generated using household opinion data from Afrobarometer surveys. Theoretically, our results suggest the importance of systematically examining presentations and perceptions about rising powers at the popular level, in addition to focusing on elite attitudes, to understand discursive change. More directly, our findings reveal that CIs are helping to improve how China is viewed among foreign publics."
Rising Powers in Global Economic Governance: Mapping the Flexibility‐Empowerment Nexus.,"Heldt, Eugénia C.; Mahrenbach, Laura C.",Global Policy,Wiley-Blackwell,INTERNATIONAL organization; DECISION making; DEVELOPMENT banks; WORLD Bank; INTERNATIONAL Monetary Fund,,"Given long‐standing criticism of global economic institutions by rising powers, it is puzzling that these same governments supported the transfer of substantial resources and responsibilities to the IMF and the World Bank during recent reform negotiations. We argue rising powers' support for international organization (IO) empowerment is linked to their concerns regarding an IO's flexibility. We introduce two types of flexibility as being most relevant for rising powers. These include governance flexibility – the extent to which rising powers may participate in IO decision‐making – and issue flexibility – the extent to which rising power preferences are incorporated into IO policies and programs. We illustrate our argument by examining the preferences of the BIC states (Brazil, India and China) towards IMF and World Bank reforms between 2008 and 2012. Drawing on archival material with over 50 statements from BIC representatives, we find, first, that there were clear links between Bank and Fund governance flexibility and the BICs' support for empowerment of these IOs, but that this was not true for issue flexibility. Second, we find evidence indicating the strategies of individual BIC governments differ within these IOs, suggesting a need to undertake more differentiated studies of rising powers' IO activities. The use of trust funds by borrowers to get what they want outside the limitations of governance structures needs to be examined more systematically and compared with pursuit of similar goals within recently created multilateral development banks and less formalized institutional structures."
Rivalry in the Middle East? Japan's CEAPAD initiative and China's rise.,"Schulze, Kai",Pacific Review,Taylor & Francis Ltd,"ARAB-Israeli conflict; INTERNATIONAL relations; KOKUSAI Kyoryoku Jigyodan; JAPANESE economic assistance; ABE, Shinzo, 1954-",China; Israel; Japan; Middle East; Palestine; strategic rivalry,"Ever since the so-called rise of China has started, Sino-Japanese relations have been increasingly described as a rivalry between both states. For the most part, this assumed rivalry has been analyzed on the global level or within the boundaries of the East Asian region, while the consequences of this rivalry for other world regions, such as the Middle East, have been largely neglected in the literature. In order to fill this gap, this article investigates how China's growing presence in the Middle East, and in particular regarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, influences Japan's own foreign policy in this troubled region. It utilizes a modified concept of the strategic rivalry approach, called 'asymmetric rivalry', which challenges the widespread notion that rivalry needs to be mutually perceived by both sides and thus analyzes the assumed Sino-Japanese rivalry in the Middle East from a Japanese perspective. By focusing on the case of Japan's CEAPAD initiative, which aims at coordinating East Asian countries' developmental assistance towards the Palestinian Authority while deliberately excluding China, the present article shows that the perception of Japan's foreign policy elite of China as a rival decisively influences how Japan's foreign policy is shaped in the context of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict."

Existing work on military disobedience focuses on group dynamics; this article instead investigates the circumstances under which individual officers disobey. We argue that officers interpret military orders based on their concurrent positions in multiple social networks and that, contingent on the soldier's environment, such orders can ""activate"" tensions between overlapping social network identifications. These tensions create motivations and justifications for disobedience. We develop this theory via in-depth case studies of individual officers' disobedience in the Chinese military and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), combined with an examination of 10 additional cases outlined in an online appendix. Relying on primary sources, we demonstrate how identifications with overlapping social networks led two ostensibly dissimilar officers to disobey in similar ways during the Sino-French War (1883–1885) and the Lebanese Civil War (1975–1989). Our theory thus shows how overlapping social networks create conditions of possibility for even well-trained, loyal commanders to disobey their superiors. In doing so, it highlights the critical fact that even within the context of intensive military discipline and socialization, individuals draw on identifications with varied social networks to make decisions. Further, it implies that individual disobedience should be studied as conceptually separate from collective events such as mass desertion or unit defection."
Role of Ideas in the China–India Water Dispute.,"Ho, Selina; Neng, Qian; Yifei, Yan",Chinese Journal of International Politics,Oxford University Press / USA,INTERNATIONAL conflict; WATER supply; COOPERATION; CHINA-India relations; WATERSHEDS -- China,,"Both the Chinese and Indian governments have made assiduous efforts to desecuritise their water dispute. This is puzzling, because both countries have securitised most of the disputes between them, including the border dispute, Tibet, and the Dalai Lama issue. The triggers for securitisation exist in the China–India water dispute. Both countries are water-scarce, prone to floods and droughts in their shared river basins, and the water dispute is inextricably linked to their border dispute. Power asymmetries between the two countries also incentivise both sides to securitise their water dispute. China, the upstream riparian and more powerful of the two, could use water as leverage in border negotiations, while India could use securitisation as a tactic to gain attention and offset China's greater aggregate power. The tendency is also for water disputes around the world to be painted as existential threats. Why, then, do China and India desecuritise their water dispute? Furthermore, despite desecuritisation, cooperation between them has remained low, confined to an expert-level mechanism, and memorandums of understandings on sharing hydrological data. This refutes the conventional view that desecuritisation is a normative good that can lead to genuine cooperation. This paper uses the Q methodology, which is a quantitative measure of ideas and perceptions, to address these puzzles. Based on a Q survey of Chinese and Indian experts on the water conflict, we argue that ideas are essential to shaping Chinese and Indian behaviour. Material explanations do not adequately explicate the complexities and nuances of the water dispute because they are too broad and general to be useful. The Q survey revealed in depth the myriad of ideas and debates surrounding the water dispute. These views and beliefs explain why the Chinese and Indian governments desecuritise their water dispute and why, despite desecuritisation, cooperation remains low."

In the case of parties such as Podemos in Spain, Syriza in Greece, and La France Insoumise he identifies populist strategies while emphasizing how, in contrast with right-wing populism, these parties are socially inclusive. However, populism research should not be satisfied with singing the same old tune that limits itself largely to stressing the authoritarian tendencies of populism but says comparatively little about the causes of the current populist revolt."
Rural migrants and their marital problems: discourses of governing and knowledge production in China.,"Sun, Wanning",Critical Policy Studies,Taylor & Francis Ltd,IMMIGRANTS; PUBLIC opinion; LEARNING & scholarship; SOCIOECONOMIC factors; SCHOLARLY publishing,China; hukou; inequality; marital problems; rural migrants; suzhi,"Since 2010, there has been a noticeable increase in China's academic publications about young rural migrants' love life. Social scientists play a crucial role in shaping public opinions and policy formations regarding the welfare of individuals from this disadvantaged group. Knowledge about rural migrants' marital problem – the nature of their problem, its causes and possible solutions – provides legitimation to the government's social policies, and for this reason it warrants careful investigation. Taking an interpretative policy analysis approach, the article analyses the recurring narrative and discursive frameworks in the Chinese-language scholarship. Furthermore, it juxtaposes scholarship produced inside and outside China in order to bring into sharp relief the 'Chinese characteristics' of China's scholarly publications in the fields of social sciences. The article also discusses why the private life of rural migrants has become a source of political and social anxiety. This discussion demonstrates the complex connection between socioeconomic inequality, social policy formations, and the cultural politics of class in post-socialist China."

Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Kirghizstan and Tajikistan has been a highly contested region in world politics due to geo-political, cultural and economic reasons. In the post-Cold War era it became the center of euphoric expectations for the regional as well as world powers - expectations that ranged from energy to geo-strategic balances and imbalances, and to the Fukuyama brand of 'triumph of liberal democracy' in the region. Shattering of those dreams reduced the region's profile in international politics. However, recently it has again emerged with a potential of politico-economic development. From the formation of the Eurasian Economic Union (2015) to the continuing political and economic instability in the region, all in the backdrop of rise of China as an emerging world power, the rising Russian profile in Central Asia is again being discussed in policy-making circles. In this context, this paper offers an overview of the Eurasian concept(s) with particular reference to the Russo-Central Asian politics and policies that are likely to cause a profound impact on regional and international dynamics in the future. It's chief argument is that due to Moscow's growing interest, the historical Eurasian Heartland is likely to play a more decisive role in the coming decades."

Russia in the South China Sea: Balancing and Hedging.,"Korolev, Alexander",Foreign Policy Analysis,Oxford University Press / USA,INTERNATIONAL relations; SOUTH China Sea; HEDGING (Finance); STRATEGIC alliances (Business); CHINA-Russia relations,,"Although on the surface Russia remains distant and disengaged from the South China Sea (SCS) dispute, its comprehensive strategic partnership relations and large-scale arms deals with China and Vietnam—Russia's closest Asian allies but also major rival parties to the dispute—reveal that Moscow has strategic interests and goals that affect, directly or indirectly, the evolution of the dispute. Russia's ambivalent stance toward the dispute in the form of supporting both China and Vietnam is the manifestation of two different modes of great power behavior that unfold at different levels but happen to intersect in the SCS. One is systemic balancing, which is aimed at checking and blocking the strongest power in the system—the United States. The other is regional hedging, which combines engagement and containment and helps to avoid taking one side at the obvious expense of another. These two different modes of great power behavior coexist in Russia's behavior toward the SCS. Untangling the two levels sheds light on the essence and evolution of Russia's policies in the region, which have created a win-win situation, however imperfect, for China and Vietnam and have contributed to the formation of a more manageable negotiation environment."

By strengthening cooperation with the navies of these countries in different parts of the world, Moscow demonstrates its political preferences and military capabilities by checking the combat readiness of its own Navy, as well as modernizing its strategy and tactics, taking into account the modern experience of combat operations among the other fleets. It then presents a valuable opportunity for Russia to defend its national interests while remaining a non-aligned and predictable actor. By analyzing the dynamics, metrics and substance of Russia's naval activities, the author tries to clarify the strategic goals of the Russian and other countries' navies, and also to define some qualitative characteristics, such as the level of interaction between the Russian Navy and each of its partners, operational tasks of the exercises, etc. In addition, Russia's joint maneuvers not only maintain its status as a great maritime power and raises its international authority but also may serve as a balancing factor for the U.S. and Chinese navies to improve the security situation in the Asia--Pacific."
Russian Neo-Revisionism.,"Sakwa, Richard",Russian Politics,Brill Academic Publishers,,anti-hegemonic alignment; China; Cold War; hegemony; neo-revisionism; ressentiment; revisionism; Russia; the West,"A revisionist state would seek to challenge the existing balance of power in the system and threaten the foundations of the system itself. This does not apply to contemporary Russia. It seeks to enhance its status within the existing framework of international society. Russian neo-revisionism does not attempt to create new rules or to advance an alternative model of the international system but to ensure the universal and consistent application of existing norms. Russia's neo-revisionism represents a critique of western practices in defense of the universal proclaimed principles. It is not the principles of international law and governance that Russia condemns but the practices that accompany their implementation. This reflected Russia's broader perception in the post-Cold War era that it was locked into a strategic stalemate, and that the country was forced into a politics of resistance. This has taken many forms, including the creation of an anti-hegemonic alignment with China and others. For Moscow, it was the West that had become revisionist, not Russia. Although the implementation of applicable norms was patchy, Russia did not repudiate them. In its relations with the European Union, Russia's neo-revisionist stance means that it was unable to become simply the passive recipient of EU norms, and instead tried to become a co-creator of Europe's destiny. The struggle is not only over contested norms, but also over who has the prerogative to claim their norms as universal. However, it was precisely at the level of practices that there was least room for compromise, and thus Russian neo-revisionism became another form of the impasse, and only intensified tensions between Russia and the Atlantic system."

They had been evacuated to the Philippines island of Tubabao by the International Refugee Organization (IRO) from Shanghai to escape the advancing Communists. This was a surprising move on Australia's part, given longstanding suspicions of Shanghai's Russian and Jewish community on grounds of immorality and political unreliability and the large-scale commitments Australia had already made to take 'displaced persons' from Europe in the wake of the Second World War to meet its labour shortages. Despite an avowed commitment to the strictest security and health vetting, Australia ended up accepting Russians from Tubabao – on average substantially older than its target migrant demographic, disinclined for manual labour and with a high incidence of TB – with only minimal security screening, despite widespread concerns that many held or had held Soviet passports.

Analyzing what drives Russia's energy diplomacy with China can therefore shed important light on the dynamics of Russian foreign policy-making. We go beyond other recent studies of this topic by examining the role of domestic political influences and the countries' bilateral interactions. We show that personalist elements influence both Russia's policy-making and its diplomacy with China. The personalism has made it hard for Russia to coordinate the relevant decision-making institutions and get the most from its energy strength. The economic gains from recent energy deals, particularly to Russia's Far East, have been less than expected, and Russia has met only limited success in achieving its foreign-policy priorities in the Asia-Pacific region. Moving forward, Russia must further institutionalize its decision-making process, limit the role of personalism, and better coordinate the activities of its energy firms with the goals of its central agencies and local governments."

However, the increased dependence on China carries its own risks, such as the danger of becoming Beijing's junior partner. For an erstwhile superpower that continues to declare and prize its autonomy in international affairs, this is a particularly unappealing prospect. Thus, it remains to be seen whether a genuinely balanced partnership can exist between both countries. This article uses insights from Adam Watson's pendulum theory to explore Russia's post-2014 Eurasian predicament. We argue that the rapid rightward swing of the pendulum in the Euro-Atlantic order following the end of the Cold War has proven indigestible for Moscow. The article then moves to discuss the Sino-Russian relationship in the context of the emerging Eurasian space. It concludes that the growing disillusionment of Russian leaders with the West since the 2000s, along with the normative convergence between Moscow and Beijing, has led to a closer partnership between the two. Yet the partnership is also riddled with a number of insecurities on Moscow's side that could undermine the long-term prospects for cooperation between Russia and China."

This article examines the domestic and ideational motivations that underlie Russia's interactions with China. It is argued that Russia's behavior toward China demonstrates in particular the importance of ideas at the domestic level. Moscow's increasingly close relationship with China serves to confirm Russia's perceived status as a great power, which functions as a fundamental tool of regime legitimacy. In addition, Russia and China have grown closer on national identity issues that are constituted in opposition to political and ideological principles endorsed by the West as universal values."
Sailing through Troubled Waters and towards 'Someplace ...'.,"Exadaktylos, Theofanis; Guerrina, Roberta; Massetti, Emanuele",Journal of Common Market Studies,Wiley-Blackwell,ECONOMICS; SOCIAL science research; INTERNATIONAL trade; WORLD politics; ADMINISTRATIVE & political divisions,,"Some key events of 2018, such as the start of the Yellow Vest populist and protest movement, as well as the victory of populist and eurosceptic parties in the Italian general election, suggest that the EU status quo is fragile. In addition to the ever more strained relations with the USA, the EU also had to face up Chinese assertiveness, particularly its belt and road initiative (BRI), which threatens to weaken the relative weight of the EU in global economic partnerships and even to penetrate deep into Europe, dividing EU member states. Indeed, the EU has tried to counter the Chinese initiative by launching an alternative EU-Asia connectivity strategy in September 2018 (European Commission, [13]), while Germany and France have demanded that BRI negotiations in Europe may occur only between China and the EU as a united actor. Although the imposition of austerity policies has pushed left-wing populist parties to adopt a more radical criticism of the EU, these political forces remain overwhelmingly within the category of soft euroscepticism (Conti and Memoli, [10]; Della Porta I et al., i [12]; March and Rommerskirchen, [27];)."
Say on purpose: lessons from Chinese corporate charters.,"Lin, Li-Wen",Journal of Corporate Law Studies,Taylor & Francis Ltd,CORPORATION law; CHARTERS; MISSION statements; CHINA; CORPORATIONS; INDUSTRIAL management,,"What is the purpose of the corporation? The debate has continued for a long time without a clear answer partly because corporate law is often silent or ambiguous on the purpose of the corporation. The debate is largely academic and has limited dialogues with corporations that manage business in the real world. If corporations themselves articulate the purpose in their constitutive documents, it might be helpful to resolve the corporate purpose controversy. China offers a valuable empirical setting to examine how corporations formally state the purpose in their corporate charters. The empirical findings in this article show that the purpose clause in the articles of incorporation is not static but evolving with institutional and organisational demands. However, the purpose clause serves only a signalling or marketing function because of external and intrinsic constraints."

Morrison says the shift in the US-China relationship from engagement to competition is ""inevitable,"" calling for the Indo-Pacific to deepen patterns of cooperation so the competition does not become adversarial. Australia was an early adopter of the Indo-Pacific concept, describing it as a useful geographic construct. Now Australia is embracing the Indo-Pacific not merely as construct, but as a US strategy - the Free and Open Indo-Pacific."

Based on close reading and careful analysis of 679 private letters from 1961 to 1986, this article explores the self-cultivation of socialist personhood by a politically devout married couple and their close relatives, who shared with one another how they lived and felt. A tension between personal concerns with family life and an ideologically charged commitment to personal political progress are identifiable in many of the letters and provide a key to understanding the rise and fall of political commitment and socialist personhood over the course of two decades. The conjugal letters reveal that within this family the husband strategically chose a discourse of class struggle and the wife a discourse of gender equality, and each utilized politically prescribed language to push for their own agenda within the family. It will be seen how the combination of their concerns with family life, the tensions entailed in the gender discourse, and the rise of materialist concerns in the 1970s eventually contributed by the 1980s to their abandonment of communist ideology and self-cultivation."

Capitalist transformation of Chinese agriculture in the context of continuing strong government control over farmland provides a unique opportunity to assess the validity of Marx's hypothesis that private landownership is a barrier to capitalist development in agriculture and that state ownership of land is a possible way to overcome it. Analysis highlights two advantages of the current system for the capitalist transformation of Chinese agriculture. First, by enabling local governments to transfer large and consolidated tracts of farmland to agribusiness companies and large farmers and relieving them from the burden of dealing with each and every private owner for land access, the semi-private landownership system minimizes the transaction costs incurred by agrarian capital. Second, farm workers are guaranteed access to small plots of land and this subsidizes agrarian capital by reducing the costs of the reproduction of labor power, thereby putting downward pressure on wages.

Third, capitalist firms determine the wage level in order to extract labor. The paper demonstrates that semi-proletarianization is one of the three stages of the long-term dynamics of a dual economy like China. In so doing, it provides an alternative to the Lewis turning point literature. JEL Classification : B51, O53, E24"
Sentencing Disparities in Corruption Cases in China.,"Gong, Ting; Wang, Shiru; Li, Hui",Journal of Contemporary China,Taylor & Francis Ltd,CRIMINAL sentencing; JUDICIAL discretion; CRIMINAL judgments; CHINA; SUPREME People's Court (China); CORRUPTION lawsuits,,"In China, the dramatic increase in the number of trials and convictions of corrupt officials leads to the question of how they were sentenced and by what criteria. The puzzle is, in particular, to what extent judicial discretion plays a role in sentencing corrupt officials and, if judicial discretion does exist, how the discretionary power is exercised. This article addresses these questions based on 7304 court judgments in 2014-15, which were obtained from the official website of the Supreme People's Court. The authors' analysis reveals strong evidence of the presence of a high level of judicial discretion and considerable inconsistency in court judgments. This article further explores the possible explanations for sentencing disparities in corruption cases to show how extra-judicial factors may influence judicial decisions."

This paper takes the Ningbo government cloud data center as an example to analyze the problems and obstacles of centralized sharing,"Governments have vast data resources related to a wide-variety of policies and programs. Integrating and sharing data across agencies and departments can add value to these data resources and bring about significant changes in public services as well as better government decisions.

Blockchain - a decentralized peer-to-peer distributed ledger technology - provides a new way to develop sharing mechanisms. In addition, blockchain-based systems are difficult to tamper with and are highly traceable. Based on the current problems of a big data center in the city of Ningbo, China, this paper identifies limitations of this approach and explores the potential of some data sharing mechanism based on blockchain technology. Our analysis describes some potential advantages and the feasibility of using distributed data sharing and automated management mechanisms based on blockchain smart contracts.

By comparing different versions of the multilateral Code of Conduct negotiations between 1992 and 2016, the authors find that the sovereignty issue has been shelved throughout the negotiations. We identify three factors that may account for this finding: the inconsistency of China's official claims over time, China's increased bargaining power, and the importance of the shelved sovereignty axiom since the era of Deng Xiaoping. The authors conclude that the normative game continues in the shadows of international norms represented by invalid sovereignty over the contested waters."

Shrinking room for hedging: system-unit dynamics and behavior of smaller powers.,"Korolev, Alexander",International Relations of the Asia-Pacific,Oxford University Press / USA,WORLD politics; INTERNATIONAL relations; POWER (Social sciences); GROSS national product; EUROPEAN Union; HEDGING (Finance),,"This article advances the understanding of 'hedging' in international politics by highlighting and examining the limits to smaller powers' hedging behavior. Building on the line of reasoning that hedging is an outcome of regional or state-level, rather than system-level, variables, the article suggests that the room for hedging available to smaller states shrinks as great powers become more competitive and attempt to balance against one another. With an empirical focus on the post-Cold War South China Sea region, particularly the evolving behavior of the Philippines, Vietnam, and Malaysia, the article demonstrates how, under the conditions of growing China–US competition, these regional states start moving from hedging to more pronounced bandwagoning vis-à-vis great powers regardless their domestic-level sociopolitical dispositions. Therefore, hedging has limits and can be envisaged as a 'luxury' that is inversely related to the intensity of great power balancing."

In this study, China's Eurasian Pivot is approached as a creativity strategy from the perspective of social identity theory. In order to succeed in its creativity strategy, China is trying to create a common in-group identity with the Silk Road Economic Belt countries through the Chinese Dream. However, the Chinese Dream is not perceived as a common identity by Central Asians and Uyghurs. While Central Asians respond China's economic presence in the region positively, they are afraid of demographic changes and cultural influences that Chinese migration will cause. Therefore, the Chinese Dream has been a common fear for Turkic societies along the Silk Road Economic Belt rather than common identity. This fear could be one of the most important factors that will prevent the success of China's Eurasian Pivot in the long run."

The relationship has been generally positive for both sides. However, at the same time, there are areas of friction including charges of Chinese ""neo-colonialism,"" similar to those leveled against Chinese ventures elsewhere. My study of China's relations entails case studies of Cuba, the Bahamas, and Jamaica, which I supplement with an examination of the Dominican Republic and Haiti's political and economic relations with China. It shows most Caribbean countries have not noticeably changed their foreign or domestic policies because of their economic linkages with China, though there is variation in these countries' specific responses to their economic ties with China, which is a function of diverse international and domestic economic and political variables. Regardless, Beijing's views are given more consideration than previously. As noted in the article, China's push into the Caribbean is increasingly resented by the United States and could play a role in bringing a New Cold War to the region.

Drawing on primary data from in-depth, face-to-face interviews with 250 respondents and supplementary information from archival sources and personal observation, the study found that small-scale gold mining is an area legally reserved for Ghanaian indigenes, who faced stern competition from some Chinese migrants' miners. Their ability to mobilize resources and machinery to execute galamsey virtually displaced the indigenes from their source of livelihood and caused environmental catastrophes. The Ghana Government's policy response to the Chinese migrants' galamsey, which led to arrests, sentencing and deportations of some Chinese miners, angered Beijing and fractured Ghana–China diplomatic ties. But the dispute could not collapse the entrenched bilateral relations between the two nations because the calculated mutual benefit derived from the relations was thought to be higher than the Chinese galamsey issue. Policy reforms which legally integrate Chinese migrants' miners into the small-scale mining sector would stop galamsey and strengthen Sino-Ghana relations."

The first part, China makes headlines, provides a brief insight into how China is making inroads as a major actor, pushing itself towards a reformist agenda while making sure that its selfinterest is not damaged. Mearsheimer's theory of neo-realism is studied in this regard. In the second part of the part, the strategic relationship of South Asian states, post 9/11 has been studied with respect to the theory of balance of power, with United States and India vs Pakistan and China Strategic Quadrangle. It is concluded that in comparison to United States and India, Pakistan and China's strategic partnership presents itself as a hallmark of 'Grand Security Strategy.' In the third part of the paper, with reference to the strategy of Bandwagoning and Balancing, scholarly discussion by Robert Ross, David Shambaugh and David Kang is detailed. The authors discuss the insecurities of Southeast Asian states and the balance they are trying to maintain between United States and China. They argue that 'balance of influence' is being maintained, evading the concept of balance of power. Fourthly, the paper debates the world of economic interdependence and states (US and China) which will dominate the 21st century. It relates this factor with specific reference to the European states, since their economies have majorly been at stake. The paper is limited to studying Sino-U.S. Competitions and Changes for the Global Political Order in the region of South Asia and European States. Conclusively, placing China into an international order does not come by choice, instead it is a necessity. Henceforth, U.S. needs to ensure that China is not seen as a disruptive but a positive force with which international affairs have to be restructured and balanced."
Sino-Western Cognitive Differences and Western Liberal Biases in Chinese Political Studies.,"Guo, Baogang",Journal of Chinese Political Science,Springer Nature,CROSS-cultural differences; WESTERN society; DEMOCRACY; CHINA -- Politics & government; WESTERN countries; CHINA studies,Asian values; Binary thinking; Chinese cognitive pattern; Liberal democracy; Political psychology; Sinicization; Socialism with Chinese characters; Western liberal bias,"Many scholarly publications in the field of Chinese political studies show a strong Western liberal bias. Very often we find their descriptions and predictions on China to be inaccurate or false. To probe the problem of Western liberal bias, this study uses a multidisciplinary approach to analyze the Sino-Western cognitive habits and the cultural and historical roots of these differences. We find that there are some important cognitive differences between Chinese and Western people. These differences may derive from their linguistic, psychological, and genetic variations, and are closely associated with their different political values, preferences, and behavior patterns. The implication of these finding suggests that some of the Western liberal ideas may not be congruent with Chinese culture which emphasizes social harmony, rule of ethics, and respect to authority. Effort to promote Western liberal democracy as a universal value does not take into consideration of these important cognitive and cultural differences."
Situated Payments for Ecosystem Services: Local Agencies in the Implementation of the Sloping Land Conversion Programme in Southwest China.,"He, Jun",Development & Change,Wiley-Blackwell,ENVIRONMENTAL protection; LAND use -- Government policy; CHINA; PAYMENTS for ecosystem services; ECOSYSTEMS; INCENTIVES in conservation of natural resources,,"Payments for Ecosystem Services (PES) is an innovative initiative to use market instruments for conservation that has spread across the world since the late 1990s. In assessing the efficiency and effectiveness of PES initiatives, global scholarship has focused on an outcome‐oriented approach. This has led to debate on PES programmes' contributions to, and the trade‐offs between, conservation and development. Taking the Sloping Land Conversion Programme (SLCP) in China as an example, this article uses a process‐oriented analytical approach to provide novel understandings of PES as a specific type of development practice. The article shows how notions of equity and justice, local knowledge and local institutions have played a role in shaping the processes and outcomes of the SLCP. The actions of local stakeholders in an interplay with the state created a space for negotiating, adapting and adjusting PES implementation, which eventually contributed to a local development pathway for meeting both national conservation interests and local economic development needs. This indicates that attention to situated agency can help illuminate how PES can be smoothly implemented and effectively negotiated in developing countries."

This study investigates the present situation, development approach and public acceptability of the Slow City concept in China. Based on the theory and the practical application of the Slow City concept in major member countries, the development process of Slow City can be divided into three stages: the origin stage, the development stage and the promotion stage. This study shows that the Slow City development in China is at the third stage. Due to diverse economic foundations, cultural traditions and the sociopolitical environment, the Slow City in China represents different features compared to the Slow City in Europe. A systematic analysis provides a better understanding of the situation of the Chinese Slow City. Then, the authors evaluate the degree of acceptability of the Slow City concept in China based on three aspects: the understanding, the awareness, and the popularity of the Slow City. Based on the results, this paper suggests optimistic growth opportunities for the Slow City in China and provides several strategies with regard to diverse perspectives."
Social Cleavages and Preferences for Government Redistribution in Contemporary China.,"Huang, Xian",Studies in Comparative International Development,Springer Nature,INCOME redistribution; PUBLIC administration; PUBLIC opinion; SOCIAL policy; EQUALITY; POLICY sciences; GOVERNMENT policy; CHINA,China; Inequality; Public preference; Redistribution; Social cleavage,"Public preferences for redistribution are important for policymaking in authoritarian countries such as China, where political legitimacy has relied heavily on improving the population's well-being and is likely to be impaired by growing levels of social inequality. What are ordinary Chinese preferences for government redistribution? Do they differ from the public preferences observed in advanced industrialized economies, or are they similar to those found in other developing or post-communist countries? Drawing on the World Values Survey of China for 1990 to 2012 and a multilevel data analysis, I find that Chinese preferences for government redistribution vary significantly with income, occupation, and place of residence as existing studies of advanced industrialized democracies and other developing countries predict. Moreover, Chinese preferences notably fall along state–private sectoral and labor-market insider–outsider cleavages generated by the country's state socialist legacy and its newly developed market economy. These findings suggest that in contemporary China, multiple social cleavages coexist and interweave in such a way as to fragment society without fracturing it along a single and deep class line. This study helps advance understanding of the societal foundations of redistributive policies and politics in China and in transitional societies with newly developed market economies in general."

Measures of social disadvantage are based on China's hukou system of household registration (designed to limit domestic migration flows by denying urban public services to migrants with rural registrations) and on son preference (stemming in part from the strict one-child policy). Regression results indicate that a rural hukou status is negatively associated with children's weight-for-age Z-scores, even after controlling for household characteristics, and girl children exhibit poorer nutritional status than boys. Results from a quantile decomposition procedure confirm that left-behind children have lower nutritional scores than children who migrate with their parents, and the gaps are biggest at lower portions of the distribution."

This article builds on Robert Putnam's conceptualization of maching and schmoozing as formal and informal forms of social involvement, respectively. Using the 2012 Chinese General Social Survey, we identify four types of participants in social involvement, namely the inactives, machers, schmoozers and all-rounders, to untangle various aspects of social life in China. Our empirical analysis shows that the sociodemographic positions of the four types of social involvement are largely distinct. Our findings also contribute to the study of political trust by offering insight into the complicated associations between social involvement, hukou status and political trust in contemporary Chinese society."

This essay explores the use and interpretations of official discourse on governing society since the late 1980s to understand what is new about this concept. I examine key central documents and scholars' interpretations of their language in order to analyse the changes in the Party's stated thinking on governance, and to demonstrate the importance of central document analysis in understanding Chinese politics. I find that the term social governance does not have one clear, static meaning and that to argue otherwise would be misleading. Rather than developing in a linear way, as is often assumed, the concepts used in official discourse are found to be ambiguous and at times contradictory. This plays two important roles. It creates space for scholars to use official discourse as a channel for political participation, while at the same time facilitating the use of official language as technique for governing its users."

Yet it does not mean the power of media is unlimited in the authoritarian context. Using China as a case, this article tries to point out the limitations of the media's role in promoting religious freedom by reviewing the existing literature on media and social control. It stresses that the nature of religious issues, the accessibility of information, and the social consensus among netizens contribute to the difficulty in enhancing religious freedom and rights protection in China at this moment."

Focussing on AIIB's Environmental and Social Framework (ESF) this paper explores the conceptualisation of social risk, asking whether it is predominantly shaped by China's own experience with growth by infrastructure and related tools such as the Social Stability Risk Assessment (SSRA) or whether it owes more to social sustainability standards of pre-existing multilateral lenders. Based on key person backgrounder interviews in late 2016 and documentary review, including of AIIB's inaugural loan approvals, the authors find more evidence of international than national characteristics, confirming AIIB's adoption of its ESF as institutional isomorphism. This conclusion brings new perspectives to debates on the BRI's underlying development model with particular emphasis on the potentially enhancing inclusion of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Delivering positive outcomes for people affected by AIIB projects is vital for keeping the international support that also affects the success or failure of the entire BRI."

Due to different sociopolitical environments and public policies regarding homosexuality, individual-level factors such as education, income, age, and religiosity operate in distinct ways in the three societies. The more progressive environment in Taiwan allows more room for the manifestation of individual-level influences, compared to mainland China and Singapore. With respect to homosexuality, the tolerance-promoting effects of education and income and the tolerance-depressing effects of age and religiosity are significantly more pronounced in Taiwan than in mainland China and Singapore. Broader sociopolitical environments not only affect the overall level of tolerance of homosexuality in a society but also shape what individuals in the society are more tolerant."
Social upgrading and cooperative corporate social responsibility in global value chains: the case of Fairphone in China.,"JINDRA, BJÖRN; HATANI, FAITH; STEGER, THOMAS; HIEMER, JOHANNES",Global Networks,Wiley-Blackwell,SOCIAL responsibility; WELFARE funding; CHINA; VALUE chains; SUPPLY chains,CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY; FAIRPHONE; GLOBAL VALUE CHAIN; GOVERNANCE; SOCIAL UPGRADING,"In this article, we explore how a lead firm's strategy for corporate social responsibility influences the social upgrading of a supplier in a global value chain. Based on a single case study approach, we investigate the interaction between Dutch smartphone producer Fairphone and its Chinese supplier Guohong. On the one hand, the case illustrates how a cooperative approach to corporate social responsibility can lead to progress in suppliers' social upgrading. In particular, we highlight the role of a so‐called workers' welfare fund as a mechanism not only for improving measurable labour standards but also for enabling rights. On the other hand, the case demonstrates how the limited production and technological capabilities of the suppliers, a competitive market environment and lead firms' limited strategic access to the supply chain might constrain the extent of social upgrading through a cooperative approach towards corporate social responsibility in a global value chain."
Soft Power and Hard State: China on the Global Stage.,"Ratha, Keshab Chandra",IUP Journal of International Relations,IUP Publications,STATE power; CULTURAL movements; INTERNATIONAL cooperation; INTERSTATE relations; CHINA; FOOD sovereignty; DEVELOPING countries; CHINESE; ASIANS,,"China's soft power is apparent in areas of its religion, traditional culture, universities, mandarin as lingua franca, media, tourism, sports, Chinese Diaspora and China's political/cultural presence in South East Asia and Africa. The Chinese policy makers have emphasized the peaceful nature of China's rise by offering free aid and infrastructural development to developing nations, respecting the sovereignty of others, opposition to superpower hegemony, advocacy of level playing field in interstate relations and focus on multiculturalism. China is now taking good steps for its projection of cultural power and influence beyond its borders. It is found that the movement of intense cultural and intellectual engagement between multiple actors inside and outside the country is to make others understand what China is and what the world really means to China. China insists ""Harmony is most precious"". It lays stress on international cooperation while addressing the issue. The objective of this paper is to justify how China is great in the eyes of the world due to its attractive political values, cultural attractiveness and governance model. China's participation in the UN Peace keeping activities is an important arm of public diplomacy to project China as a responsible power. China applies its heart and soul to peace keeping activities with a desire to become a responsible global player. The peaceful rise of China helps to dispel the doubts of other nations regarding its rise as a threat. The main intention of this paper is to evaluate the projection of China's soft power on the basis of its culture, political values, and foreign policies along with formidable challenges ahead."

In the years between the Sino-Soviet Split in 1961 and the beginning of the Cultural Revolution in 1966, China strove to substantiate its commitment to US black liberation in three key respects: consistent news reporting, sentimental receptions of visiting black activists, and local gatherings that publicized up-to-date information on US anti-racist struggles and featured ordinary citizens sharing notes of empathy. This multidimensional Chinese engagement of US black freedom struggles helped to cement both intra-national and international solidarities. The party state, its mouthpieces, and everyday students and workers echoed Mao Zedong's dictum that racial discrimination was a matter of class struggle. Embedded within their observations was a critical analysis of African American history and social movements in relationship to US capitalism. Their narrations of black resistance and Afro-Asian solidarity, while intimately bound up with nation-state interests, shed light on the intricate nexus of race, revolution, and international class struggle that defined the global Cold War."

I applaud all these bold ventures, while making some additions and criticisms. The main reason warfare dominated in both Chinese and European history in earlier times was that both saw the colonial expansion of core states over peripheral regions, and the ""deflection"" of war onto less civilized peoples made them an easier target. Thus, war was more rational for the core states. I also dispute his claim that political power is the primary source of power. Although this is a reasonable conclusion for much of Chinese history, in other contexts the ideological power of the world religions or of twentieth-century communism and fascism dominated, while military power dominated the history of the Roman Republic, and the economic power wielded by capitalism dominates some parts of the world today. All four sources have the capacity to dominate in certain contexts."

The article addresses the sources of toleration in this new global scenario, starting from the following set of questions: Do the sources of toleration differ across time and space? Does toleration have different roots in different civilizational contexts, such as China, India or Islam? Or, is toleration the result of particular institutional frameworks and designs? In this case, does the concept of toleration vary from one institutional setting to the other? Do empires, republics and democracies give rise to different forms of toleration? And last but not least, isn't toleration rather a matter of individual morality, as many liberal theories sustain? The article distinguishes between three different sources of toleration: individuals, cultures and institutions. Kant and contemporary liberals, as John Rawls who follows him, situate the source of toleration in the individual itself and the capacity for practical reason. More communitarian-oriented thinkers, as Michael Walzer, defend 'a historical and contextual account of toleration and coexistence', arguing that 'the best political arrangement is relative to the history and culture of the people whose lives it will arrange'. The institutionalist account, which goes back to John Locke's A Letter Concerning Toleration establishing the separation between state and church, holds that it is the right institutional design that grounds toleration. The article concludes that political strategies aiming to cultivate toleration must take into account the causes of intolerance."

Although there is a natural focus on the risk of military conflict in space between the United States, China, and Russia, South Asian security will also be affected by space competition. Indian space capabilities are developing rapidly, and are emerging as one of the more advanced regional space programs; there is clear risk that Chinese and Indian space competition will increase. A key feature of twenty-first-century space security dynamics is Space 2.0, in which commercial space actors can exploit new technologies and approaches to accessing and utilizing space. For India, exploiting Space 2.0 is an important step, in particular to balance Chinese counterspace capabilities."
South Asian Security Framework: A Three-Dimensional View.,"Kumar, Shiv",IUP Journal of International Relations,IUP Publications,GLOBALIZATION; REGIONALISM; NATIONAL security; INTERNATIONAL relations; SOUTH Asia -- Politics & government,,"During the late 20th century, a wave of regionalism and globalization opened up opportunities for the South Asian countries to lay down the South Asian security framework. The initiative began with the establishment of SAARC, followed by BIMSTEC and Mekong Ganga Cooperation. However, the traditional rivalry between India and Pakistan and their diverse approaches such as Pakistan's policy toward its Western neighborhood and India's approach towards its Eastern neighbors through its 'Act East' policy, increased mistrust and divergence with regard to regional cooperation. At the same time, the geostrategic presence of great powers such as the US, China and Russia is also instrumental in the paradigm shift in the South Asian security framework, especially after the 9/11 attack. The paper analyzes in depth the South Asian security framework through the three dimensional layers, that is, internal building based on Indo-Pak traditional rivalry; regional measures, through historical, cultural, religious and commercial connectivity among the South Asian countries; and the role of great powers in the regional security framework. Since these factors are responsible for either fracturing or nurturing the regional security framework in the region, the paper analyzes these core multi-layer factors in determining the South Asian security framework as a myth or reality in the 21st century."

The KORUS FTA has been pushed for renegotiation while the China–South Korea trade relations have stumbled after the THAAD deployment to South Korea. This challenge can be characterized by the economic-security nexus shifted from positive to negative: that is, South Korea is compelled to either sacrifice its economic benefits in favor of security interest or vice versa. In contrast to Japan that seeks to retain TPP as a way of benefitting from a regionwide trade integration and balancing both Trump unilateralism and Chinese mercantilist influence, South Korea is forced to play a more complex game. Given its deep yet asymmetric economic interdependence with China and North Korean security threats, South Korea needs to accommodate China while at the same time courting US engagement in resolving the North Korean nuclear problems."

There is a growing bipartisan consensus in the United States: that China has taken advantage of the United States for far too long; that China has overtaken, or will soon overtake, the United States in areas of advanced technology, such as artificial intelligence and some aspects of military technology, through underhand means; that instead of opening up and becoming more like the United States, China has regressed in terms of political openness, and hence represents a challenge to American values and leadership. U.S. businesses feel let down that China has not adjusted its policies on trade and investments, and in fact systematically disadvantages foreign businesses operating in China, while Chinese businesses operate uninhibited in the United States.

It looks at the entry of approximately 50,000 Chinese migrants into the informal small‐scale gold mining sector from 2008‐2013. These migrants mainly hailed from Shanglin County in Guangxi Province. In Ghana, they formed mutually beneficial relationships with local miners, both legal and illegal, introducing machinery that substantially increased gold production. However, the legal status of Chinese miners was particularly problematic as, by law, small‐scale mining is restricted to Ghanaian citizens. In mid‐2013, President Mahama established a military task force against illegal mining, resulting in the deportation of many Chinese miners. The article examines the experiences of both Chinese migrants and Ghanaian miners. Findings are that irregular migration into an informal sector had long‐lasting impacts and played a significant role in the transformation of economic, political, and physical landscapes in Ghana."
Space Security Dilemma: India and China.,"Lele, Ajey",Astropolitics,Taylor & Francis Ltd,DILEMMA; SECURITIES; CHINA; INDIA; OUTER space; SPACE,,"There is an ongoing debate on an India-China space race. Both states have made investments in the space domain for the last few decades for social, scientific, commercial, and military reasons. The January 2007 anti-satellite test conducted by China significantly raised international concerns on issues concerning space security. China's strategic space program is witnessing major advances, and China's attainments in the space arena in terms of its financial investments, expanse of programs, technology proficiency, and future plans are ahead of those of India. At the same time, both states are pursuing programs such as the development of navigational networks and missions to the Moon and Mars. In this context, it is of interest to analyze China's increasing focus on satellite technologies and India's response. This article analyzes the possible manifestation of a ""security dilemma"" in the context of outer space among these states and concludes that the dilemma is suggestive, but not definitive."

The study uses provincial‐level data from 2003 to 2012 for 29 Chinese provinces to conduct both global and spatial models. The results indicate significant spatial variation in the impact of regional economic capacity on Korean company locations, and this leads to inconsistent global model results. Moreover, the spatial results show spatial differences between the manufacturing and service sectors. This implies that company expansion strategies in China's balanced growth era should consider this provincial spatial heterogeneity of economic capacities."

Spatiotemporal Characteristics of Drought in the Heihe River Basin Based on the Extreme-Point Symmetric Mode Decomposition Method.,"Feng, Kai; Su, Xiaoling",International Journal of Disaster Risk Science,Springer Nature,TIME series analysis; CHINA; DECOMPOSITION method (Mathematics); WATERSHEDS; WAVELET transforms; CLIMATE change; DROUGHTS,China; Drought; Heihe River Basin; Spatiotemporal drought analysis,"Assessment of spatiotemporal characteristics of drought under climate change is significant for drought mitigation. In this study, the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) calculated at different timescales was adopted to describe the drought conditions in the Heihe River Basin (HRB) from 1961 to 2014. The period characteristics and spatiotemporal distribution of drought were analyzed by using the extreme-point symmetric mode decomposition (ESMD) and inverse distance weight interpolation methods. Four main results were obtained. (1) The SPEI series of the upper reaches of the HRB at different timescales showed an upward trend (not significant) during 1961–2014. In the middle and lower reaches, the SPEI series exhibited significant downward trends. (2) The annual SPEI series of the lower reaches was decomposed through the ESMD method and exhibited a fluctuating downward trend as a whole. The oscillation showed quasi-3.4-year and quasi-4.5-year periods in the interannual variation, while a quasi-13.5-year period occurred in the interdecadal variation. The interannual period plays a leading role in drought variation across the HRB. (3) The entire research period was divided into three subperiods by the Bernaola–Galvan segmentation algorithm: 1961–1966, 1967–1996, and 1997–2014. The spring drought frequency and autumn drought intensity arrived at their maxima in the lower reaches during 1997–2014, with values of 72.22% and 1.56, respectively. The high frequency and intensity areas of spring, summer, and autumn drought moved from the middle-upper reaches to the middle-lower reaches of the HRB during 1961–2014. (4) Compared to the wavelet transform, the ESMD method has self-adaptability for signal decomposition and is more accurate for drought period analysis. Extreme-point symmetric mode decomposition is a more efficient decomposition method for nonlinear and nonstationary time series and has important significance for revealing the complicated change features of climate systems."

National People's Congress; CHINA -- Politics & government,,"This article attempts to discover whether the National People's Congress (NPC), China's law-making body, is becoming more specialized and thereby losing its rubber-stamp image. The exploration of the composition of the NPC's permanent committees demonstrates that specialization is indeed a discernible trend. More and more social elites have been co-opted onto them. The empirical results further attest to the usefulness of the information efficiency theory. Unfortunately, specialization has yet to give the Chinese legislature more autonomy. Only 30% of committee members are privileged to serve more than one five-year term. The influence of the Party-state core and the lack of membership stability have put additional restraints on the NPC's autonomy."
Sponsorship behaviour of the BRICS in the United Nations General Assembly.,"Dijkhuizen, Frederieke; Onderco, Michal",Third World Quarterly,Taylor & Francis Ltd,INTERNATIONAL cooperation; BRICS countries; UNITED Nations. General Assembly; UNITED Nations. Security Council -- Resolutions; CHINA -- Foreign relations,BRICS; co-sponsorship; cooperation; network analysis; UN General Assembly,"The formation of informal groupings of states is a manifestation of the global shift in economic power. One such a grouping is the BRICS, consisting of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, which stands out for its importance due to its economic weight, its coverage across continents and the numerous internal differences. The BRICS have collectively flexed their muscle and expressed their intentions to extend their cooperation at the United Nations (UN). Proposals in the United Nations General Assembly (UN GA) take the form of resolutions, which can be written and co-written by the UN member states. This so-called sponsoring of resolutions is a way to push agenda items forward. Using a large-N network analysis, we examine the patterns of co-sponsorship of the BRICS of resolutions adopted in the UN GA plenary sessions. We find that the BRICS cooperate on fields such as economic issues, however, they do not form a coherent bloc when it comes to resolution sponsorship. These results raise the question in what way the BRICS actually cooperate at the UN level."
Spurred by Threats or Afraid of War? A Survey Experiment on Costs of Conflict in Support for Military Action.,"Gleditsch, Kristian Skrede; Tago, Atsushi; Tanaka, Seiki","Peace Economics, Peace Science, & Public Policy",De Gruyter,PUBLIC support; THREATS; ECONOMIC impact; EXPERIMENTAL design; CHINA; JAPAN; BINOCULAR rivalry; COST,arming; China; interdependence; Japan; public opinion; territorial disputes,"It is commonly assumed that perceived threats from a rival state will make individuals more likely to ""rally-round-the-flag"" and support military action. Previous studies have looked at how information about threats affects public support for military action. To date, however, there has been less attention to how information about the costs of conflict affects support for military action in response to threats. In this article, we present a survey experiment designed to evaluate how information about the likely military and economic costs of conflict influences support for military action. We provide Japanese respondents with information about relations with China, and probe how support for military action in the context of the ongoing territorial dispute changes with varying information on the military costs of conflict and its economic consequences. We find that information about trade ties and military capacity exerts a pacifying effect and strengthens opposition to military action. Consistent with our proposed mechanism, we show that greater awareness of military costs is associated with stronger opposition to military action. Our results indicate that even under the existence of external threats, greater awareness of the costs of conflict affects attitudes to military action and can increase support for peaceful solutions to territorial rivalries."
"STABILITY IN TOKYO, DISRUPTION IN WASHINGTON.","SMITH, SHEILA A.; MCCLEAN, CHARLES T.",Comparative Connections: A Triannual E-Journal on East Asian Bilateral Relations,Center for Strategic & International Studies,"POLITICAL stability; JAPAN-United States relations; TRUMP, Donald, 1946-",,"2018 came to a relatively quiet close for the US and Japan. Prime Minister Abe Shinzo secured a third term as leader of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) in a party election on Sept. 20 and is now set to be Japan's longest serving prime minister. In contrast, President Donald Trump faced an electoral setback in the November midterms. With Democrats taking over the House of Representatives in January, pressure on the administration will grow. In December, Trump dismissed Chief of Staff John Kelly and Defense Secretary James Mattis, and locked horns with the incoming Democratic Party leadership over funding for his border wall. Nevertheless, the US-Japan relationship seemed steady. In September, Prime Minister Abe agreed to open bilateral trade talks and in return sidestepped the Trump administration's looming auto tariffs. Yet there are differences over their goals, suggesting that continued compromise will be needed. Abe worked hard in numerous summits to position Japan in Asia in the final months of 2018. He visited China, hosted India's prime minister in Tokyo, and restarted the negotiations with Russia on the northern territories. Japan also announced its next long term defense plan and a five-year, $240 billion implementing procurement plan that includes a considerable investment in modern US weapon systems."
Stability through Multilateral Cooperation: China and Regional Security in Africa.,"Lammich, Georg",ACPR: African Conflict & Peacebuilding Review,Indiana University Press,REGIONALISM (International organization); AFRICAN Union,African Union; China-Africa cooperation; hybrid-interregionalism; regional security,"This article addresses the increasing cooperation between China and regional organizations in Africa and analyzes the impact this cooperation has on the continent's security landscape with special regard to the role of the African Union (AU). China increasingly engages with the AU in various security-related issues and new cooperation mechanisms have been established. However, China's involvement in African security is not based on any long-term strategy, but rather reflects the changing interests of various Chinese actors engaging in Africa. For the AU, China's increasing involvement represents an opportunity to extend its influence in the region and establish itself as an envoy for Africa's external relations."
Stark Choices: Work-Family Tradeoffs among Migrant Women and Men in Urban China.,"Zhao, Menghan; Hannum, Emily",Chinese Sociological Review,Taylor & Francis Ltd,MIGRANT labor; UNEMPLOYMENT; IMMIGRANTS; LABOR market; LEAST squares; REGRESSION analysis; CHINA,,"China's so-called floating population of rural-urban labor migrants includes rising numbers of couples and families migrating together. Labor market outcomes may differ for migrant men and women, in part due to family obligations, but few recent studies have investigated this possibility. This paper focuses on the relationship of labor outcomes with family obligations among migrant men and women and considers whether this relationship differs among those with higher and lower earnings potential. We perform nested logit models of employment status and ordinary least square regression analyses of income, using a nationally representative survey collected in 2013. For migrant women, childcare responsibilities are positively associated with unemployment and negatively correlated with income. In contrast, for migrant men, being coresident with children has no bearing on probability of being unemployed and is sometimes positively associated with income. Further, the ""motherhood penalty"" in income is most pronounced among migrant women with the least education. Results illustrate the embeddedness of individual migration decisions and outcomes within families. Findings also highlight a stark choice facing many migrant women: between earning for their children and living with them."
State Building Amid Resistance: Administrative Intermediaries and the Making of Colonial Taiwan.,"Matsuzaki, Reo",Polity,University of Chicago Press,"NATION building; INTERMEDIARIES (Information professionals); QING dynasty, China, 1644-1912",colonialism; Japan; state building; state-society mediation; Taiwan,"Taiwan under Japanese rule (1895–1945) is among the most successful examples of state building in the modern era. It is also a case where success was unlikely: Taiwan was an ethnically divided and violent frontier region of the Qing empire, where heavily armed communities had resisted attempts by rulers to exert control over their affairs for centuries. Unable to obtain the willing cooperation of community leaders in substantiating government authority within the locality, Japanese officials nevertheless succeeded at state building by transforming traditional institutions of state-society mediation into disciplinary instruments, thereby compelling community leaders to act against their own interests and aid in the realization of Japan's modernist reforms. The case of colonial Taiwan has broad implications. It demonstrates what it actually would take to succeed at state building within the contexts and conditions commonly found in today's ungoverned and undergoverned spaces, and it problematizes the prevailing notion that state building by imposition is compatible with liberalizing and democratizing reforms."
State Control and the Effects of Foreign Relations on Bilateral Trade.,"Davis, Christina L.; Fuchs, Andreas; Johnson, Kristina",Journal of Conflict Resolution,Sage Publications Inc.,BILATERAL treaties; GOVERNMENT business enterprises; COMMERCE; INTERNATIONAL economic relations; GLOBALIZATION; ECONOMIC globalization; WORLD Trade Organization; INDIA -- Foreign economic relations; CHINA -- Foreign economic relations,China; foreign economic policy; India; state-owned enterprises; trade interdependence,"Can governments still use trade to reward and punish partner countries? While World Trade Organization (WTO) rules and the pressures of globalization restrict states' capacity to manipulate trade policies, politicization of trade is likely to occur where governments intervene in markets. We examine state ownership of firms as one tool of government control. Taking China and India as examples, we use new data on bilateral trade disaggregated by firm ownership type as well as measures of political relations based on bilateral events and United Nations voting data to estimate the effect of political relations on import flows since the early 1990s. Our results support the hypothesis that imports controlled by state-owned enterprises are more responsive to political relations than imports controlled by private enterprises. This finding suggests that politicized import decisions will increase as countries with partially state-controlled economies gain strength in the global economy. Extending our analysis to exports for comparison, we find a similar pattern for Indian but not for Chinese exports and offer potential explanations for these differential findings."

This article contributes novel findings by focusing on China's relations with Europe and the actions of China's National Nuclear Companies (NNCs). It shows that NNCs, which have become relatively autonomous actors, often pursue their agendas of expansion into Europe without much coordination with, or even in contradiction to, other ministries' agendas and interests, especially the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Instead of being orchestrated by the central government, their expansion reflects considerable disorganisation and sometimes undermines China's official strategy. The article demonstrates this through case studies of NNCs' involvement in the UK and Romania."
State‐mediated Brokerage System in China's Self‐funded Study Abroad Market.,"Lan, Shanshan",International Migration,Wiley-Blackwell,FOREIGN study; TRANSNATIONAL education; FOREIGN students; STUDENT mobility; HIGHER education -- China,,"The thriving of China's self‐funded study abroad market is marked by the tremendous increase of students who use the services of educational intermediaries to facilitate their transnational journeys. This is largely due to the marketization of China's higher educational system and the liberalization of state policy towards commercialized brokerage services. Based on multi‐sited fieldwork in China and Italy, this paper examines the intersections between the regulatory, the commercial, and the social dimensions of the educational migration infrastructure in China. It identifies a tension between the neoliberal ideas of individual autonomy and freedom, which are promoted by the state and private intermediaries, and the self‐perpetuating nature of the educational migration infrastructure, which facilitates and constrains different groups of parents' and students' desire for international education."
STATE-OWNED ENTERPRISES: NO CLIMATE SUCCESS WITHOUT THEM.,"Benoit, Phillippe",Journal of International Affairs,Journal of International Affairs,,,"State-owned enterprises (SOEs), in the aggregate, emit more energy greenhouse gases than the entire European Union and every country except China. SOEs are also major providers of zero-carbon power and other lowcarbon alternatives. Succeeding in the low-carbon transition will require their engagement. Yet, they receive relatively little attention in the global dialogue on climate mitigation. In contrast to private sector companies, many of these SOEs operate under conditions that mute the impact of carbon pricing mechanisms. Moreover, they have government owners that can and are willing to use their shareholder power to support low-carbon SOE action. These distinctive features of SOEs alter the suite of climate policies and instruments to influence their operations to lower emissions. Government ownership of SOEs can provide a useful avenue for effective climate action, with the right tools . . . but challenges exist, particularly government ambivalence about climate action. Given the important but under-appreciated and underanalyzed role that SOEs will have to play in reducing emissions, this paper will identify some of the opportunities and challenges in generating greater SOE engagement in the low-carbon transition, a climate outcome that cannot happen without them."

It draws on the science studies literature on the 'co-production' of science and politics to conceptualise and analyse this relationship between the 'state of emergence' and 'state of knowledge'. I argue that the 'state of emergence' should be conceptualised not only as a real-world condition external to science that imposes itself on an otherwise pure internal 'state of knowledge', but also as a scholarly sensibility, ethos and motivation that operates 'within' it. The article illustrates the argument ethnomethodologically by interviewing International Relations scholars in China and India on how they themselves make sense of the emerging condition and justify their own positions and actions within it. Based on the interviews, I identify four co-productive registers connecting the state of emergence to the state of knowledge (the constitutive, civic, infrastructural and psychological) but also find that scholars in China and India differ in their enactment of these registers."

But emerging powers may also compete among themselves for status. While attempting to enhance their status vis-à-vis the West, the 'strategic triangle' of Russia, India, and China sometimes compete for status and influence within clubs such as the BRICS, SCO, and BRI. This pattern is difficult to explain in terms of neorealist, club, or constructivist theory. An explanation for this phenomenon is provided by social identity theory (SIT) from social psychology, which argues that groups seek a positively distinctive identity. The BRICS are able to cooperate when acting in terms of a superordinate identity. To avoid escalation of their rivalry, Russia and China have established niche diplomatic areas in Central Asia, an example of social cooperation. Status competition among Russia, India, and China both motivates and obstructs cooperation on global governance."
STRATEGIC CONCERN DEEPENS.,"DALPINO, CATHARIN",Comparative Connections: A Triannual E-Journal on East Asian Bilateral Relations,Center for Strategic & International Studies,REGIONAL cooperation; FOREIGN investments; NORTH Korea-United States relations,,"The choice of two Southeast Asian countries to host US-North Korea summits in the past year has lent some credence to claims that the region serves as the foundation for regional dialogue and cooperation. In early 2019, the region was also the recipient of extra attention when foreign investment in China began to move south, driven by US tariffs on China imposed in late 2018. However, there was little sign that new bilateral trade agreements with the US will materialize in the near term. Meanwhile, greater security cooperation with the US is more likely with the bombing of a cathedral in the southern Philippines in January serving as another harbinger of increased ISIS activity in the region and continued militarization of the South China Sea strengthening the rationale for the US-Philippines alliance but also putting more pressure on it. In political developments, Thai elections in March left questions about whether the military will remain dominant while Indonesian elections in April were less controversial, with incumbent President Joko Widodo retaining power."
Strategic Policy Issues.,,Strategic Survey,Taylor & Francis Ltd,"NATIONAL security; ARMED Forces; UNITED Nations -- Armed Forces; FOREIGN relations of the United States; NEW START Treaty, 2010; 5G networks; UNITED Nations",,"States seen as falling within the scope of the community of common destiny would accept the legitimacy of China's political system; internalise China's core interests and not act against them on pain of sanction; acknowledge that the interests of great powers (i.e., China) take precedence over customary international law; and accept that disputes should be resolved bilaterally rather than through a rules-based order, thereby conferring a permanent advantage on China. A similar price spike in 2008 saw food-export restrictions imposed by more than 30 governments, panic-buying by importing governments and more than 60 countries experiencing some form of civil unrest, which turned violent in one-third of the affected countries. In Libya, authority is contested between a UN-backed transitional government in Tripoli, which has little control over security forces, and the government in Tobruk, which claims parliamentary legitimacy and can rely on a more coherent military organisation. However, in April 2019 Haftar launched a campaign to conquer Tripoli and expel the UN-backed government, thereby delivering a serious and potentially mortal blow to the UN dialogue process. Between 2011 and 2018, Russia (often joined by China) vetoed 12 UN resolutions on Syria, blocking condemnation of government repression and demands for immediate ceasefires as well as proposals to investigate the use of chemical weapons."
Strengthening the rule of law in collaborative governance.,"Qi, Huiting",Journal of Chinese Governance,Taylor & Francis Ltd,LEGAL services; LAW; COMPREHENSION; MANAGEMENT; DESIGN,arena of power; collaborative governance; The rule of law,"Due to the incomplete legal foundation for collaborative governance, which leads to a set of problems, it is significant to promote the legal framework. Promoting the legal framework starts by enhancing 'the rule of law' in collaborative governance. This conceptual paper provides a framework for understanding the enhancement of the rule of law in collaborative governance. The enhancement of four important principles of the rule of law in key arenas of power in a collaboration is discussed. These four principles include predictability of the law, accessibility of the law, supremacy of the law, and equality before the law. Similarly, the arenas of power in a collaboration include participant selection in the antecedent phase of collaboration, process design and content selection in the process phase of collaboration, and performance measurement in the outcome phase of collaboration. This framework will shed light on the enhancement of the rule of law and the management of power relationships in collaborative governance."

It couples soft power to identity through a discourse analysis of the language used by the Chinese state in relation to soft power. It builds on a number of earlier theorizations that associate soft power with identity as a discursive phenomenon. The results highlight the use of strategic disrespect in China's soft power discourse. In the context of global cultural competition, and in particular the South-South cooperation framework, it is argued that the practitioners of the Chinese discourse present China's 'Self' as a soft power and the Western 'Other' as a hard power."

Specifically, it makes comparisons between two cross‐sectional groups: 1) Chinese students in a PRC university who intend to study abroad (with a subset that stated that the United States is their top destination), versus 2) Chinese students already at a US university. Building on a ""motility"" concept while using an ""Intellectual Migration"" conceptual framework and chi‐square and logistic regression analyses, it demonstrates that Chinese students' possibly returning to the PRC are significantly influenced by their gender, college GPA, family finance, assessment of China's current and future development. The results on outmigration or return migration intentions are presented, and it concludes with some policy implications and future research directions."

The introduction and implementation of the ""New Miyazawa Initiative"" represented that the focus of the Japanese government has shifted to the preparation for and construction of the regional local currency bond market. This was backed by the strategic consideration to restart yen internationalization (or yen re-internationalization). It reflects the Japanese government's reflection and adjustment on the path selection of promoting the internationalization of yen in the early stage. Relying on such change, The Japanese government intended to foster regional yen bond market to build yen backflow mechanism in East Asia and to realize the long-term objective of yen internationalization through ""regionalization."" On the twentieth anniversary of Asian financial crisis, this paper re-examines the change to yen internationalization strategy, which is of practical significance for other cases' attempt to internationalize local currencies as RMB internationalization at present. With reference to the strategic change in yen Re-internationalization, RMB internationalization shall shift the focus from ""trade settlement"" in the past to ""capital outflow"" through fostering the regional RMB bond market, expand RMB backflow mechanism. China shall focus on Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) and other new regional financial cooperation platforms to promote RMB regionalization, thus finally realizing the strategic objective of RMB internationalization. Nevertheless, this path selection is inseparable from China's positive attitude toward financial and capital liberalization."
Studying the Chinese Policy Process in the Era of 'Top-Level Design': the Contribution of 'Political Steering' Theory.,"Schubert, Gunter; Alpermann, Björn",Journal of Chinese Political Science,Springer Nature,"GOVERNMENT policy; POLICY analysis; POLICY sciences; CHINA -- Politics & government; XI, Jinping, 1953-",Chinese policy process; Political steering theory; Top-level design; Xi Jinping era,"Making sense of the Chinese policy process has been one of the most challenging endeavors for China scholars since the beginning of 'reform and opening up'. Although a great deal of empirical knowledge has been gathered over the years on policy-making and implementation in many different fields, theorizing on the Chinese policy process has mostly been concerned with individual policy instruments or various modes of policy-making so far instead of looking at how these are interconnected. In this article, we propose 'political steering theory' as an integrative theoretical framework to fill in this gap. Originating from policy research conducted by German social scientists starting in the 1970s, we consider 'political steering theory' to be the most appropriate approach to the Chinese case, particularly in the current era of 'top-level design' led by Xi Jinping. We demonstrate how China recently recalibrated its political steering approach and propose new directions for research into the Chinese policy process under the current administration."

These research notes apply Albert Hirschman's theory of ""exit, voice, and loyalty"" to the political and migratory situation in Hong Kong by testing whether dissatisfaction with the local political regime and pessimism about the prospects for political reform are creating a greater willingness to emigrate to countries such as Taiwan, Australia, and Canada. After reviewing official census and migration data from the four regions and estimating a Logit model of data from the 2015 Asian Urban-Wellbeing Indicators survey, the notes conclude that support for democracy is becoming an increasingly large motivator for Hong Kongers who are considering moving abroad to areas that are more politically liberal, even if not necessarily more affluent.

It demonstrates how Party-state monitoring comes not only in the form of physical monitoring and forced kinship but also automated, technology-driven tools such as GPS tracking, voice and facial recognition technologies, machine learning algorithms, and other software and hardware. The Chinese Party-state employs surveillance to delineate 'correct' thought and behaviour among its citizens, and then persuade (through coercion and inducement) self-alignment with Party and Han-defined norms. The results are fewer spaces for autonomous, bottom-up social mobilization by the Uyghurs and other minorities, the abolition of non-Han cultural, linguistic and religious practices, and the erosion of social trust in Xinjiang society."

Under such restricted conditions, international relations that allow to develop the economy and promote social progress play a crucial role for Tajikistan. Considering the country's geographic location, Tajikistan's interaction with neighboring countries plays a major role in the sphere of international relations. The paper analyzes the foreign trade relations between Tajikistan and neighboring countries-Afghanistan, China, Kyrgyzstan, and Uzbekistan. The relevance of examining Tajikistan's border trade with neighboring countries reflects the importance held by the analysis of this aspect's influence on the country's socio-economic development. Border trade, defined as the flow of goods and services over international land borders in the up to 30-kilometer range, plays an important role in supporting the livelihood of the population of the border area, and is thus a pillar of the republic's welfare. Moreover, by strengthening the trade connections and promoting mutual understanding between different communities, border trade stimulates the maintenance of friendly relations between neighbors."
Tea cafés and the Hong Kong identity: Food culture and hybridity.,"Chan, Selina Ching",China Information,"Sage Publications, Ltd.",HONG Kong (China); FOOD; CULTURAL fusion,colonialists; food culture; heritage; Hong Kong identity; hybridity; migration; tea cafés,"This article examines the meanings of caa caan teng (茶餐廳, local cafés) in Hong Kong and the implications of such cafés on the Hong Kong identity. It argues that the local café is a representation of Hong Kong culture because it reflects Hong Kong's political, economic, and social developmental paths and mirrors the everyday life of its people. I investigate how the interaction of different immigrant cultures in Hong Kong has resulted in the invention of hybrid foods at the local café. These foods demonstrate hybridity as the transgression of boundaries through the negotiation of cultural differences among migrants, as well as those between migrants and colonialists. I argue that hybridity in local cafés reflects the power relations among the locals in Hong Kong, between locals and colonialists, and between locals and the new authorities in Beijing. Hybridity found in local cafés symbolizes the Hong Kong identity, as an entanglement between the multiplicity of Chinese ethnicities and the colonial modernity as characterized by flexibility, efficiency, choice, and diversity. These features differentiate the Hong Kong people from the colonialists and the mainlanders, thus constructing their identity and subjectivity, as former colonial subjects now living in the 'periphery' of the motherland."
Technical efficiency and technology gap of the manufacturing industry in China: Does firm ownership matter?,"Walheer, Barnabé; He, Ming",World Development,Elsevier B.V.,FOREIGN ownership of business enterprises; ORGANIZATIONAL change; GOVERNMENT business enterprises; MANUFACTURING industries; TECHNOLOGICAL progress; CHINA; INDUSTRIAL productivity,Data envelopment analysis; Manufacturing industry; Metafrontier; Technical efficiency; Technology gap,"• We find that private ownership is superior to state and collective ownership in technical efficiency and technology level. • We demonstrate that foreign ownership has the best technical efficiency and the highest technology level. • Foreign-owned firms achieve substantive improvement in technical efficiency, whereas technological progress is strongest in private firms. • China's enterprise reform stimulates efficiency improvement among state-owned firms, but we find no evidence of technological progress among them. • We observe widespread technological progress among Chinese firms in almost all industrial sectors. China's manufacturing industry has undergone intense structural change during the enterprise reform. The waxing of private and foreign-owned firms and the waning of state-owned and collective firms are accompanied by dramatic technological upgrading and productivity growth. We study how ownership type affects technical efficiency and technological advancement in China's industrial sectors using detailed firm-level data. By employing a metafrontier-based technique, we are able to account for technology heterogeneity in ascertaining four types of firm ownership in 30 manufacturing sectors. The robust data envelopment analysis offers estimation flexibility and enables us to mitigate data problems. Our results confirm that firm ownership is important in explaining technical efficiency and technology gap among Chinese firms. We show that foreign-owned firms set the standard for technical efficiency and are technology leaders. Private ownership is found to dominate state as well as collective ownership in both technical efficiency and technology gap. Over time, foreign-owned firms take the lead in efficiency improvement and private firms contribute to technology advancement. We also find that China has successfully revitalized state-owned firms, although room for improvement remains. Lastly, we find evidence that China has successfully stimulated technological progress in almost all industrial sectors. We contribute to the literature by using a nonparametric estimation method that assumes technology heterogeneity when firms are partitioned into hierarchical categories. Our study also has rich policy implications on China and other transit economies."

The Trump administration has viewed China's techno-industrial plans and policies as a national security threat. Recognising the reality that it cannot afford to have a Cold War or ""cold peace"" with the United States, China has shown willingness to make concessions, but only to a certain degree. The Trump administration's growing hostility is unlikely to stop China from pursuing frontier technologies, which are a source of national competitiveness, security and pride for China as much as for the United States."
"Territorial acquisition, commitment, and recurrent war.","Kohama, Shoko",International Relations of the Asia-Pacific,Oxford University Press / USA,ACQUISITION of territory; ARMISTICES; POWER (Social sciences); INTERNATIONAL relations; CHINA -- Foreign relations -- Vietnam,,"This study investigates how territorial acquisition through war affects the durability of a successive ceasefire and determines what type of territorial acquisition is more detrimental to post-war peace. Despite the wealth of literature on recurrent war and on territory, the effect of territorial acquisition on war resumption has been understudied. This study shows that territorial acquisition creates expectations among adversaries for future power shifts, which results in a commitment problem that hinders peaceful revision of the existing ceasefire. Indeed, duration analysis of ceasefires following interstate wars since World War II shows that territorial change in war, especially acquisition of large and densely populated territories that have potential utility for greater power shifts, makes ceasefires more prone to failure. The analysis of Sino-Vietnamese ceasefires following militarized incidents over land and sea borders also illustrates the importance of territorial acquisition and the potential utility of the territory."
Territorialising Chinese Inner Asia: The Neo-Developmentalist State and Minority Unrest.,"Köpke, Sören",International Quarterly for Asian Studies,Arnold-Bergstraesser-Institut,,China; ethnic conflict; Inner Mongolia; minorities; Neo-developmentalism; territorialisation; Tibet; Xinjiang,"Despite the Chinese Communist Party's claim to inter-ethnic harmony, the human rights situation of some of the PRC's 55 o»cial minorities is problematic. The article discusses minority unrest in relation to the ongoing transformation of the country's Inner Asian frontier regions. Taking the three autonomous regions of Tibet, Xinjiang and Inner Mongolia as case studies, it examines the long-running but recently accelerated processes of modernisation and ethno-political conflict. It argues that minority policy is driven by nationalist / neo-developmentalist motives aimed at both the expansion and intensification of Chinese power, and that this process can be termed state-led territorialisation. Programmes such as the Great W estern Development and the Belt and Road Initiative are viewed through the lens of neo-developmentalist territorialisation, which is aimed at entrenching the Communist Party's control of China's frontier regions. This perspective provides explanations for conflict that cover several dimensions, from political, economic and cultural causes to ethno-political strife."
Terrorizing the CPEC: managing transnational militancy in China–Pakistan relations.,"Basit, Saira H.",Pacific Review,Taylor & Francis Ltd,TERRORISM; INTERNATIONAL relations; INTERSTATE agreements; CHINA; PAKISTAN,China–Pakistan relations; responses to terrorism; transnational militancy; violent non-state actors in interstate relations,"Despite the continuous risk posed by transnational militancy to Chinese interests in Pakistan, China and Pakistan have improved their cooperation on matters of security and economy in recent years. While transnational militancy in a state dyad is known to increase the potential for conflict, it may also spur interstate cooperation on counter-militancy operations under certain conditions. This article examines the sources of the increase in Sino-Pakistani cooperation in fighting transnational militancy. Pakistan was in the early 2000s the country where the Chinese experienced most militant attacks resulting in the cancellation of Chinese projects in Pakistan despite the dyad's professed all-weather friendship. More than a decade later, the Chinese are back with a prospected $62 billion in investments in the China–Pakistan economic corridor (CPEC). This overarching incentive has altered the challenge of transnational militancy to their mutual relations from a mostly negative, to a more constructive one requiring costly cooperation. In a quest to secure a continuing relationship in a hazardous landscape, the state dyad is attempting to roll out a concerted security strategy involving the army, navy, paramilitary forces and private security companies. A mix of domestic policies of both states, their foreign policies and the nature of threat posed by the militants facilitates this cooperation."
"Testing the ""China Model"" of Meritocratic Promotions: Do Democracies Reward Less Competent Ministers Than Autocracies?","Lee, Don S.; Schuler, Paul",Comparative Political Studies,Sage Publications Inc.,POLITICAL participation; DEMOCRACY; POLITICAL systems; EAST Asia; SOUTHEAST Asia; EAST Asians; PROMOTIONS,cabinet ministers; comparative regime types; East and Southeast Asia,"Proponents of the ""China Model"" suggest that autocracies, particularly in East Asia, reward competence more than democracies. However, a competing literature argues that autocracies are less likely to reward competence because autocrats fear that competent officials could challenge for power. We argue that autocracies do not fear technical competence ; they fear political competence. As such, autocracies may promote ministers with technical competence but punish the politically competent. Democracies, by contrast, place a premium on political competence when deciding whom to promote. We provide the first test of this theory on how ministerial behavior is rewarded using a unique data set of political performance and promotions in nine East Asian countries. Our findings show that autocracies promote officials with technical competence as long as the ministers limit their political behavior. In democracies, parliamentary and presidential democracies promote those displaying political competence."
The (Ineffective) Financial Statecraft of China's Bilateral Swap Agreements.,"McDowell, Daniel",Development & Change,Wiley-Blackwell,BILATERAL treaties; CENTRAL banking industry; BRETTON Woods System; ZHONGGUO ren min yin hang; SWAPS (Finance),,"Since 2008, the People's Bank of China has signed bilateral swap agreements (BSAs) with 35 foreign central banks. Collectively, these deals amount to nearly US$ 500 billion in Chinese renminbi (RMB) available to Beijing's foreign partners. What has led China to be so aggressive in its efforts to sign so many swap agreements? What are the political economic implications of the swap programme for the US‐centric global economic order? China's BSAs can be understood as a form of financial statecraft: the use of national financial and monetary capabilities to achieve foreign policy ends. China has deployed BSAs for both defensive and offensive reasons. Defensively, Beijing has sought to use BSAs to promote trade settlement in RMB thereby reducing China's vulnerability to the dollar's structural dominance in trade. Yet, as explained in this article, they have been ineffective in this regard. Offensively, Beijing has used BSAs as a short‐term liquidity backstop outside of the Bretton Woods institutions for partner countries in need. Here, there is greater potential for BSAs to impact the status quo economic order by enhancing Chinese economic influence. However, their potential is dependent on Beijing's willingness to act as a unilateral crisis lender and its ability to further internationalize the RMB."

Zhongguo ren min jie fang jun. Hai jun; ASIANS; CHINESE,China; China Coast Guard; institutional reform; maritime power; People's Liberation Army Navy,"In June 2018, the Chinese government initiated a new round of reforms to reshuffle the leadership of the China Coast Guard (CCG) so as to better administer the country's blue territory. In contrast to the 2013 structural reform of the Chinese government which created the CCG and made it part of the State Oceanic Administration, a sub-ministerial organ of the Chinese State Council, the 2018 reform placed the agency under direct command of the Communist Party's Central Military Commission. This paper argues that the CCG today has been a formidable maritime giant and acquired a fair ability to coordinate its patrol operations with other agencies in recent years. In particular, the maritime law enforcement force has been made more militarized given its close association with the Chinese Navy. Nonetheless, despite the notable performance the CCG has made, it still faces problems of unclear legal status and weak airborne surveillance capabilities, keeping its institutional reform far from full completion. Moreover, a more powerful coast guard force can on the one hand facilitate Beijing's aim to become a great maritime power but on the other hand lead to more security challenges as a harsher maritime contest between China and its strategic competitors is likely to be witnessed in the near future."

Nuclear arms control policy-making is very complex for the ROK because of its specific security dilemma. And the role and strategy of the ROK in international regimes are increasingly important for the ROK's security and status in the world. Thus, the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and its review process including the Review Conference and Preparatory Committee are particularly essential to the ROK. In 2020 when the 10th Review Conference will be held, the ROK should present an appropriate strategy. For this, this article first outlines the establishment and development of the NPT and its review process from 1995 to 2015, after the Cold War and the North Korean nuclear issue was raised. And it describes the ROK's role played in the NPT on the basis of its three pillars and suggests what strategies Korea must retain: Nuclear disarmament and security assurances from Russia and China; Coercing the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) to rejoin the NPT; Continuing the momentum of the Nuclear Security Summit; and Setting and leading a new agenda. This study concludes with a forecast that the year 2020 will be a major turning point for Korea."

Those, however, who know the history of the Black Continent, also know that Russian presence is not a new phenomenon. Africa was an important place during the Cold War where the Soviet Union not only competed with the United States of America, but also with China. For those who observed the robustly growing US and Chinese Africa policies, it could have appeared after the end of the classic Cold War, that the Russians had retreated beyond the borders of their country, abandoning the Black Continent in favour of their previous rivals. However, it did not happen, because the Russians did not close their diplomatic missions as they did in the former socialist countries of Eastern Europe. Furthermore, the Russians played a key role in UN Peacekeeping Missions in Africa, where they provided the necessary Air Transportation Capabilities together with the Ukrainians. Today it is becoming obvious that not only a new form of the Cold War has been resumed between the West and Russia but also the fact that the Russian ""retreat"" was only temporary. The relations with African countries are becoming increasingly important not only for the Russians, but also for the Africans, who need no longer choose between the American and the Chinese way of development. Even though the US and China did not view Russia as a competitor in the recent past, taking into account the events of the past few years the situation has changed. We also need to see that Russia—similarly to China—is primarily a competitor to US great power interests. China intends to cooperate with Russia, rather than competing, whilst not denying the existence of competition between the two countries. I would like to give a picture of this process in my study, including the changing balance of powers in Africa."
The Allure of Being Modern: Personal Quality as Status Symbol Among Migrant Families in Shanghai.,"Tian, Xiaoli",Chinese Sociological Review,Taylor & Francis Ltd,MIGRANT labor; SOCIAL status; SHANGHAI (China); COLLEGE entrance examinations; HIGH school seniors; ADOPTED children; FAMILIES; REASONING in children,,"This paper examines how the powerful suzhi (personal quality) discourse affects the subjective understanding of Chinese migrant workers toward their situation in the city in order to elucidate the microlevel processes that the lower social class acculturate to the dominant cultural capital. Many migrants from the Chinese countryside have remained in Shanghai despite that in doing so, their children are prohibited from taking senior high school and college entrance examinations. In two waves of interviews with migrant parents and children over a 10-year period, parents have justified their decision to remain in the city, reasoning that their children adopt ""modern"" habits, behaviors and lifestyles, which render them ""modernized,"" and thus elevate their social status even without a higher education. Cultural discourses with strong connotations of authority and power provide the framework that the migrants use to improve their relative social status at the microlevel. This research foregrounds the consideration of relative social status in decision making and social behavior as a microprocess through which the lower social class subscribes to a cultural discourse that reduces them to a lower position."

THE ART AND AGONY OF AVOIDING AN ALLIANCE.,YU BIN,Comparative Connections: A Triannual E-Journal on East Asian Bilateral Relations,Center for Strategic & International Studies,,,"In the last four months of 2019, Beijing and Moscow continued to broaden and deepen their strategic partnership across political, economic, diplomatic, and security areas with some visible outcomes: the 3,000-km, 38-bcm ""Power of Siberia"" gas line went into operation and the cross-border rail and road bridges were finally completed after decades of endless negotiations and delays. While Chinese and Russian top leaders jointly steered the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) and BRICS through challenging times, it was in military relations that breakthroughs were made. This included Russia's assistance in the construction of a missile attack early-warning system for China, China's participation in Russia's Center-2019 large-scale exercises, and the first joint naval exercises with Iran in the last few days of 2019. These developments took place amid continuous discussion on both sides about the nature, scope, and degree of an ""alliance"" relationship, formal or not, in an increasingly fluid and challenging world. With the rapidly deteriorating Iran-US relations at the onset of the new decade, it remains to be seen how Moscow and Beijing can keep their ""best ever"" relationship short of moving to a formal alliance, a state of affairs they have been trying to avoid for years."

Oversight of increased autonomy in warfare is critically important because this deadly technology is likely to proliferate rapidly, enhance terrorist tactics, empower authoritarian rulers, undermine democratic peace, and is vulnerable to bias, hacking, and malfunction. The top competitors in this arms race are the United States, China, Russia, South Korea, and the European Union. As the AI arms race rages on, the stakes remain high yet public debate is lacking. 61 per cent of citizens polled across more than twenty countries oppose the development of lethal AWS, and yet billions of their tax dollars are being spent on their development each year."

The previous studies mainly focused on providing a description of AIIB's creation or general motives and context through which they explicated the establishment of the Bank. Building on the literature focused on strategic culture and grand strategy, I supplement the general motives of AIIB's creation by characterizing the style and process of AIIB's materialization. I argue that the style (procedure) of AIIB's implementation largely resembles the previous Dengian model of strategic procedure which Deng himself described with the Chinese saying ""crossing the river by touching the stones"" which evinces flexibility and ""step-by-step"" characteristics in its procedure. This helps to illustrate that China's engagement with the international order can be adaptive to a significant degree and China does not necessarily follow a pre-planned vision of how to take over international (institutional) order. While China's foreign policy in some areas is often regarded as being assertive and rigidly defending its positions, AIIB is a different case to a high extent. Moreover, analyzing the creation of AIIB indicates ambiguity of Xi's foreign policy regarding general aims it wants to achieve and identities on which it should be based."

The views of political leaders, business people, the media, and analysts on the prospect of the BRI are ostensibly polarized. One group asserts that the BRI will dramatically increase Beijing's global influence, particularly in China's neighborhood. Another group surmises that the BRI is expected to fail because of insurmountable challenges and is expected to fail. This article joins the debate by exploring the impact of the BRI on Southeast Asia's regional order. The author holds a middle-ground position and argues that the actual impact of the BRI should neither be easily dismissed nor overestimated. More likely, through the BRI, China's influence in Southeast Asia will increase but not to the extent of forging a Sinocentric order in the region. This can be explained by three major factors: (a) the responses of Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and its member states toward the BRI, (b) the effects of alternative infrastructure initiatives proposed by other major powers in Southeast Asia, and (c) China's questionable ability to deliver its BRI promises."

To a great extent, this initiative can be considered a response to the still persisting negative assessments of China's fast development and its potential impact on the international community. The paper is based on the analytical categories of Ernesto Laclau and Chantal Mouffe's theory of discourse to demonstrate how discursive strategies used to promote the BRI relate to the ""symbolic opposition"" built up on the priority tasks of economic development. As a result, the Belt and Road discourse relies, to a great extent, not on the definition of what the Chinese initiative is, but on what it is not. A wide range of texts related to the official and academic discourse in China was utilized."

Under this policy platform, Beijing has pledged to invest billions of dollars in the infrastructure and industrial sectors across Eurasia and in the Indo-Pacific nations. It is widely believed that such huge amount of investment will inevitably generate significant geostrategic repercussions in these regions. In response to the BRI, the United States and other powers have come up with a 'free and open Indo-Pacific' strategy. This article attempts to address the following question: what impact is the BRI likely to have on the security ties between China and the other major players in the Indo-Pacific? The author finds that the BRI may significantly transform China's international security policy and the expansion of Beijing's security influence may further intensify the security competition between China and other major powers in the Indo-Pacific region. The article also proposes a new analytical angle for the study of geo-economics that unpacks the role of economic activities and processes in generating geopolitical intentions and catalysing geopolitical competition."

In years leading up this transition, a maturing demographic transition alongside slowing internal migration and diminishing returns to physical capital investment, all had a role in China's diminished competitiveness in low‐wage manufactured exports and the fading of the related growth model. In that context, the 2013 launch of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) took place in two stages in two developing countries, Kazakhstan and Indonesia. These launch choices, and the BRI in general are herein elaborated in terms of economic history, geography, and demography. The BRI in turn is considered to be aiming to foster the ongoing development of China, and in doing so also seeks to instigate new era development opportunity for other developing countries. One facilitation channel for the latter is China's concept of ""patient capital,"" essentially concessional capital, or foreign aid. For China that offers a means via which to internationalise the financial sector and also the Renminbi. Lessons from China's own use of foreign aid and economic development hence serve as an important reference for ongoing scoping of the shape and trajectory of the BRI. To that end, this article sheds light on what is in the BRI for China."

The current focus on individual trajectories has left the social context in which individuals radicalise underexplored. By taking a birds-eye view, this article aims to untangle the ways in which particular historic conditions and perceptions of discrimination and marginalisation following state-building practices feed specifically into the radicalisation of minority communities. Following a comparison between state-building practices in Turkey, China and Spain and the impact on Kurdish, Uyghur and Basque identity construction respectively, the authors argue that the failure to include minority groups into the identity of the state is one of the key reasons for the politicisation of minority identities. This implies the need for inclusionary policies as a response to VERLT. It is exactly through the promotion, facilitation and execution of inclusive policies that the OSCE can make an important contribution."

Based on public opinion data, this study analyzes how the Taiwanese public perceives the state of U.S.–Taiwan relations, and how certain they are about America's overall commitment to Taiwan in this era. Results indicate that people in their 20s, pan-Green partisans, and those favoring Taiwan independence perceive U.S.–Taiwan relations to be better under President Trump. Moreover, supporters of the pan-Green coalition and of Taiwan independence, together with the more ""ambivalent"" respondents, likewise feel more certain about America's commitment to Taiwan's security. On the contrary, pan-Blue partisans and Taiwanese citizens with mainland Chinese ethnicity are generally more pessimistic and skeptical about U.S.–Taiwan ties and partnership with Trump in the White House."

I examine how party membership affects people's choice of employment, occupational attainment, and earnings, while including changes in the function of individual attributes and human capital. I endeavor to cover both urban and rural areas and gain a dynamic understanding of the topic. The proportion of people who joined the CCP as they grew older was relatively stable in the three surveys, while the overall education level of party members increased rapidly with time. Party membership and education had a statistically significant and positive effect on non-farm employment choice and earnings, but those effects decreased rapidly over time in rural China. In contrast, party membership and education exerted more and more of an effect on employment choice, occupational attainment, and earnings in urban China. Furthermore, in both rural and urban areas, the rate of return to education and the earnings premium for CCP membership are converging at the same level. This is evidence worthy of attention as it indicates that labor markets throughout the country are becoming integrated."
The China Model of Public Diplomacy and its Future.,"Zhao, Kejin",Hague Journal of Diplomacy,Brill Academic Publishers,DIPLOMACY; LEADERSHIP; INTERNATIONAL relations; CHINESE Communist Party; CHINA -- Foreign relations,China Model; party diplomacy; public diplomacy,"Summary: Since 2012, China's top leadership has argued that China's public diplomacy should integrate with the 'New Model of Major-Country Diplomacy with Chinese Characteristics'. Among this series of initiatives, China formulates a public diplomacy model that is different from those of other countries. China's model of public diplomacy falls under the unified leadership of the Communist Party of China (CPC), but coordinates various public diplomacy players culturally rather than institutionally. The current trends of China's public diplomacy include to evolve from listening to telling, and to be more confident, positive and active. Based on empirical studies, this article concludes that China's public diplomacy since 2012 has created a unique model that emphasises cultural and other informal norms under the CPC's leadership. Moreover, public diplomacy will be regarded as a necessary wisdom to understand how China has integrated with the world harmoniously."

The China–Japan–Korea Trilateral Free Trade Agreement: Why Did Trade Negotiations Stall?,"Zhang, Muhui",Pacific Focus,Wiley-Blackwell,COMMERCIAL treaties; TRADE negotiation; LEADERSHIP; ECONOMIC development; KOREAN business enterprises,China; free trade agreement; Japan; Korea,"Launched in 2013, the China–Japan–Korea Free Trade Agreement (CJKFTA) negotiations have slowed in recent years. The three countries have convened at 14 rounds of negotiations but failed to make any substantial breakthrough. A number of previous studies have presented a crisis‐driven approach in explaining the progress of the CJKFTA, and argue that the accomplished China–Korea Free Trade Agreement (CKFTA) will accelerate the CJKFTA negotiation. This study questions optimism over the CJKFTA, and investigates the reasons for the stalemate of ongoing negotiations. It does so by considering three sets of factors that have stalled the negotiation – economic interdependence, domestic politics, and industry interest groups – in addition to international politics/national FTA policies. First, the trilateral economic interdependence shows a downward trend in recent years and has weakened the necessity of having a trilateral FTA. Second, domestic sectoral interests remain highly divergent over a potential CJKFTA; opposition from loser groups in Japan remains strong, and the majority of the Korean business world still regard the utility of an accomplished CKFTA more highly than an accomplished CJKFTA. Finally, the three countries have failed to narrow the gaps during past negotiations because no party views the CJKFTA as a top priority, nor wishes to take the leadership. China does not want a high‐level CJKFTA; Japan's lack of political incentive and Korea's cautious ""wait and see"" stance have also led to a stalemate of the negotiations. In consequence, this article delivers a relatively pessimistic vision for the CJKFTA negotiation in the near future."

The Chinese Unitary Multinational State: A Normative Reappraisal.,"El Kholi, Hugo",Nationalities Papers,Cambridge University Press,MULTINATIONAL states; SOCIALISM; MINORITIES; ETHNIC groups; NATIONAL characteristics; CHINESE Communist Party; CHINA,ethnopolitics; Marxism with Chinese characteristics; minzu; national self-determination; revolutionary praxis; theory of nationality,"This article provides a normative analysis of the rationale behind the creation of the Chinese unitary multinational state. Far from being irrelevant in the face of the well-known aversion of scientific socialism for normative thinking, such analysis illuminates the Chinese Communist Party's long-standing commitment to the unitary multinational state as the best response to the national question. It shows that the Party's leadership, in a conscious effort to adapt Stalin's theory of nationality to Chinese revolutionary praxis, substantially revised the standard conception of national self-determination. Relying on its own materialist logic, it made participation in the struggle against alienation the normative basis to justify granting ethnic minorities special rights of regional autonomy under a common state. The creation of the Chinese unitary multinational state appears in this light as a normatively coherent attempt to guarantee that all ethnic groups that contributed to national liberation benefit equally from their imprescriptible right to collective self-determination."

A consistent theme that emerges is the importance of ideological factors in driving the events are discussed. It is also clear that the Third World states were not passive objects of pressure from great powers but had agendas of their own. These books provide useful material for theorists of international relations and policy makers."
"The Communist Party-Dominated Governance Model of China: Legitimacy, Accountability, and Meritocracy.","Gore, Lance L. P.",Polity,University of Chicago Press,PUBLIC administration; GOVERNMENT accountability; CHINA; CHINESE Communist Party,accountability; China model; Chinese communist party; good governance; legitimacy; meritocracy,"As the single ruling party, the Communist Party plays an essential role in public administration and policy making in China. Under general secretary Xi Jinping's program of ""modernizing the governance system and governing capability"" of the party since November 2013, administrative power is migrating from the government to the party. The party bureaucracy is interlaced with the state bureaucracy to produce a rare model of governance, which in turn has created many conceptual and theoretical issues for the study of good governance. This article analyzes China's party-dominated governance model. Key issues of legitimacy, accountability, and meritocracy are discussed in an effort to delineate the advantages and problems of this model, analyze how it helps to shape the Chinese polity, and shed some light on good governance in general."
The concept of hedging and its application to Southeast Asia: a critique and a proposal for a modified conceptual and methodological framework.,"Haacke, Jürgen",International Relations of the Asia-Pacific,Oxford University Press / USA,INTERNATIONAL relations; POST-Cold War Period; ENERGY security; INTERNATIONAL markets; FINANCIAL security; HEDGING (Finance),,"In the context of the complex unipolar post-Cold War period that has witnessed China's reemergence as an economic and military power, small and middle powers are increasingly considered to be hedging. This analysis is especially prevalent in relation to Southeast Asian countries, many of which face security challenges posed by China. However, as the literature on hedging has expanded, the concept's analytical value is no longer obvious. Different understandings of hedging compete within the literature, and there are many criteria by which hedging is empirically ascertained, leading to confusion even over the basic question of which countries are hedging. In response, this article presents a modified conceptual and methodological framework that clearly delineates hedging from other security strategies and identifies key criteria to evaluate whether smaller powers are hedging when confronting a serious security challenge by one of the major powers. This framework is then applied to Malaysia and Singapore."
The Confucian Legalist State and Theory Building Based on Ideal-Type Set.,"Zhao, Dingxin",Chinese Sociological Review,Taylor & Francis Ltd,"SOCIAL change; CAPITALISM; RESOURCE allocation; POWER (Social sciences); CHINA; CONFUCIAN-Legalist State, The (Book)",,"In this essay, I address two major concerns raised by the reviewers of my recent book The Confucian-Legalist State. The first is on the theory of social change that I have developed in my book, and the second is about my explanation of why an indigenous breakthrough to industrial capitalism was impossible in China, despite its highly commercialized economy. I address the first issue by explicating the nature and value of ideal-type-set based deduction in theory building, and the second one by clarifying three methodological issues involved in historical comparison. The essay is concluded with a key point of my book–history is developmental but not progressive."

It discusses its vision and principles, as well as its objectives. I also present a selection of particularly significant and emblematic programs of activities. A core question is how its members will realize their main objective, to contribute to the quality of global development. And how do they relate their objective to the Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations? Aspects of the current framework of the social quality approach (SQA) will be applied in order to deepen this exploration. In the context of this study, it is relevant to cite the decisions by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences to assist the elaboration and dissemination of the SQA."

The Dao of foreign policy: Understanding China's dual strategy in the South China Sea.,"Rosyidin, Mohamad",Contemporary Security Policy,Taylor & Francis Ltd,INTERNATIONAL relations; SOUTH China Sea; CHINA -- Foreign relations,Chinese foreign policy; Daoism; dual strategy; South China Sea; strategic culture,"In the South China Sea, China neither implements power-maximizing policy nor engages a peaceful approach. Instead, China implements both coercion and cooperation in pursuing its strategic interest in the disputed area. How can we explain China's paradoxical behavior? This article claims that the best way to explain China's policy in the South China Sea is to understand the character of dualism in China's strategic culture. Following constructivist theory that stresses culture, this article argues that Chinese duality approach in the South China Sea is rooted in the philosophy of Daoism. The symbol of Yin-Yang depicts Chinese assertive as well as cooperative behavior in dealing with the South China Sea dispute. Although from a normative perspective Daoism recognizes pacifism and non-violent behavior, the most important feature of Daoism is the assumption that reality consists of two opposing elements that are mutually embedded."
The Death Penalty for Foreign Drug Offenders in China: Legal Protection and Equal Treatment.,"Liu, Siyu; Xiong, Moulin; Liang, Bin",European Journal on Criminal Policy & Research,Springer Nature,LETHAL injection (Execution); CRIMINALS; PROBATION; CAPITAL punishment sentencing; INTERNATIONAL law; CHINA,Capital sentencing; China's death penalty; Equal treatment; Foreign drug offenders,"China has been under international pressure for the death sentences meted out to foreigners for drug-related offenses. Domestically, the sentencing of foreign offenders is perceived to be too lenient compared to that of the natives under similar circumstances. We discuss the due process protections in processing foreigners charged and convicted for capital drug offenses within the context of international law. Further, to empirically assess the sentencing of such cases, we use a sample of 192 cases including both offender groups to examine the role of citizenship status, case characteristics, and defense arguments on the outcome of either an immediate or suspended death sentence. Findings indicate that foreign offenders raise different defense arguments compared to that of native offenders; but citizenship status does not play a key role in the multivariate model; rather the number of defense arguments accepted by the court and the processing time help predict the sentencing outcome."
The determinants of fiscal transparency in Chinese city-level governments.,"Sun, Shuo; Andrews, Rhys",Local Government Studies,Taylor & Francis Ltd,"TRANSPARENCY in government; CROSS-sectional method; TRANSFER payments; QING hua da xue (Beijing, China); CHINA -- Politics & government",China; Fiscal transparency; local government; principal–agent theory,"The transparency of the fiscal performance of governments has attracted attention from researchers, policy-makers and practitioners around the world. This study examines the determinants of fiscal transparency in the city-level governments of China, which has become a key issue in the drive to modernise the Chinese state. Employing cross-sectional data from the 2017 Statistical Yearbooks published by the official statistical institutions and the 2017 Fiscal transparency report of city-level governments edited by the Tsinghua University, this study finds that economic development, economic openness, and dependence on transfer payments are associated with weaker fiscal transparency. Large cities, those with high levels of internet usage and cities higher up within the Chinese administrative hierarchy are associated with stronger fiscal transparency. The theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed."
The Development-Insecurity Nexus in China's Near-Abroad: Rethinking Cross-Border Economic Integration in an Era of State Transformation.,"Hameiri, Shahar; Jones, Lee; Zou, Yizheng",Journal of Contemporary Asia,Taylor & Francis Ltd,INTERNATIONAL economic integration; ECONOMIC development; INTERSTATE relations; CHINA; BURMA; DECENTRALIZATION in management,Belt and Road Initiative; China; development–security nexus; economic integration; Myanmar; state transformation,"Surprisingly, perhaps, China's flagship Belt and Road Initiative expresses a familiar mix of the security–development nexus and liberal interdependence thesis: Chinese leaders expect economic development and integration will stabilise and secure neighbouring states and improve inter-state relations. However, drawing on the record of China's intensive economic interaction with Myanmar, we argue that the opposite outcome may occur, for two reasons. First, capitalist development is inherently conflict-prone. Second, moreover, China's cross-border economic relations today are shaped by state transformation – the fragmentation, decentralisation and internationalisation of party-state apparatuses. Accordingly, economic relations often emerge not from coherent national strategies, but from the uncoordinated, even contradictory, activities of various state and non-state agencies at multiple scales, which may exacerbate capitalist development's conflictual aspects and undermine official policy goals. In the Sino-Myanmar case, the lead Chinese actors creating and managing cross-border economic engagements are sub-national agencies and enterprises based in, or operating through, Yunnan province. The rapacious form of development they have pursued has exacerbated insecurity, helped to reignite ethnic conflict in Myanmar's borderlands, and plunged bilateral relations into crisis. Consequently, the Chinese government has had to change its policy and intervene in Myanmar's domestic affairs to promote peace negotiations."

The dilemmas of regional states: How Southeast Asian states view and respond to India-China maritime competition.,"Singh, Sinderpal",Asian Security,Taylor & Francis Ltd,MARITIME law; SOUTHEAST Asia; CHINA-India relations,,"This article examines contemporary perceptions and the corresponding responses of Southeast Asian states vis-à-vis India-China maritime competition. Specifically, it examines the cases of Singapore, Vietnam, and the Philippines. These countries provide useful cross-comparisons as, bilaterally, all three states relate uniquely to China and the maritime disputes in the South China Sea on the basis of two structural conditions - their formal security relationship with the US and whether they are a claimant state in the South China Sea dispute. The link between the range afforded by these three cases and the manner in which it drives their perceptions towards India-China maritime competition forms the core of this article. These three countries perceive differing levels of threat from China and have chosen a range of external balancing strategies to deal with these perceived threats. The nature of US-China and India-China security competition, the latter specifically in the maritime realm, structures the external balancing strategies they have pursued. There are, this article argues, important links between US-China and India-China strategic competition in structuring the external balancing strategies these countries pursue."
The Diverse Role of Women in Shaping Hong Kong's Landscape of Gentrification.,"Ye, Minting; Vojnovic, Igor",Urban Affairs Review,Sage Publications Inc.,GENTRIFICATION; POOR women; POOR people; HONG Kong (China); SERVICE economy,gender; gentrification; Hong Kong,"Women in different cities, in different parts of a city, or even in the same neighborhood are involved in or affected by gentrification in different ways. Given the increasing socioeconomic status of women and their changing demographic characteristics, women can be viewed as the agents in the growing service economy that are driving gentrification. However, women are also the victims who suffer most from gentrification due to the feminization of poverty, a ubiquitous global phenomenon. Women, being overrepresented among the poor, have confronted great burdens associated with physical and social upgrading. Yet this aspect of women, as victims of gentrification, has not received its due attention, particularly in China. This article explores socioeconomic changes experienced in Hong Kong's economy between 1986 and 2006, and resulting gentrification processes. It also provides an empirical analysis into the diverse role of women in Hong Kong's landscape of gentrification, as both agents and victims."

This article seeks to redress this deficiency, and supplements geopolitical analyses with a domestic politics perspective. It brings back the centrality of domestic politics.

The domestic resonance of geopolitical competition in American foreign policy: the rise of China and post-war US–Soviet relations compared.,"McCourt, David M.",International Politics,Palgrave Macmillan Ltd.,GEOPOLITICS; NATIONAL security; FOREIGN relations of the United States; UNITED States,Communism; Domestic politics; Rise of China; US foreign policy,"For the first time since the end of the Cold War, the USA faces a geopolitical challenger in the shape of China. According to the National Security Strategy 2017 (NSS 2017), China—alongside Russia—poses a threat to America primacy, a view that reflects a new consensus among national security experts about the need to get tough in relations with Beijing. As of now, however, American public opinion remains ambivalent on the China challenge—opinion polls showing only a modest downturn in views of China recently, despite pronounced anti-China rhetoric in the context of the Trump administration's trade war. The present paper asks why there is such a disparity between elite and popular opinions, and whether the disparity will last. It does so through a historical comparison between the present and the immediate post-WWII period, before a threat from the Soviet Union resonated widely among the American public. Acceptance of a Soviet threat was a product of a rhetoric of anti-communism used in partisan political debate. In turn, anti-communism drew on a conflation of ""communism"" meaning US-based labor groups and communism meaning the Soviet Union. By showing the immense effort needed to manufacture the resonance of geopolitical competition in the post-war years, the paper highlights the necessary domestic conditions of geopolitical competition, conditions currently absent."

However, this article, considering the period 1949–1979, shows that American and Indian perceptions of and policy toward China shaped the US–India relationship even during the Cold War. In doing so, the article seeks not just to bring China back into the story of past US–India relations, but also shed light on the China–India–US triangle of today and of tomorrow."
The dragon versus the kangaroo: perceptions of Chinese and Australian influence and development assistance in Vanuatu.,"Clarke, Matthew; Feeny, Simon",Australian Journal of Political Science,Taylor & Francis Ltd,INFLUENCE (Psychology); ECONOMIC development projects; VANUATU; PERCEPTION; AUSTRALIAN economic assistance; CHINESE economic assistance,Australia; China; development assistance; Soft power; Vanuatu,China's engagement within the South Pacific has increased dramatically in recent years mainly through significant increases in development assistance. Development assistance is provided to address humanitarian needs but to also secure national interests of the donor. This paper examines the extent and nature of Australia's and China's influence in Vanuatu from the perspectives of the Ni-Vanuatu people using new data. China is perceived as having the most influence in the country despite Australia's development assistance being viewed far more positively. Support for infrastructure is the most important factor contributing to a positive image for both countries. Perceptions of land grabbing are the main factor contributing to negative images. Regional differences in perceptions of Australia and China across Vanuatu also exist.
The Dual Demands: Gender Equity and Fertility Intentions after the One-Child Policy.,"Zhou, Yun",Journal of Contemporary China,Taylor & Francis Ltd,"GENDER inequality; LABOR market; DISCRIMINATION in employment; FERTILITY; ONE-child policy, China; CHILD care",,"This article investigates fertility intentions and obstacles among young Chinese men and women after the lift of the one-child policy. Over 100 in-depth interviews reveal that while having one child is viewed as the normative step following marriage, various obstacles remain for second-birth transition. Time and financial concerns are salient among both men and women, whereas labor market disadvantage and the perceived incompatibility between work and motherhood create additional hindrances for women. The gendered childcare leave policy, coupled with discriminatory hiring practice, leads women to view multiple childbirths and successful career as fundamentally incompatible. A universal 'two-child policy' without additional institutional measures that address work-life incompatibility for women may not successfully boost fertility level, but would rather exacerbate the existing gender inequity in China's labor market."

By applying the latest 2012 Chinese multi-regional input–output table, this study evaluated the impacts of carbon tax on tax burdens and sectoral competitiveness in Chinese provinces when considering either production-based or consumption-based emissions. Our results indicated that, in the scenario of cutting production tax for carbon tax, the developed provinces, such as Beijing, Shanghai, Zhejiang, and Jiangsu, who are much bigger payers of production tax, are net beneficiaries of carbon tax. In contrast, recycling the tax revenues to low-income households makes the less-developed provinces in the central and western China become net revenue receivers. Furthermore, for competitiveness effects, the emission intensive sectors, such as Electricity and hot water production and supply, Petroleum and gas, and Metal products, are impacted vitally under both accounting principles in all provinces. Nevertheless, compared with the production-based principle, a consumption-based carbon tax could reduce the unfavorable competitiveness effects of most affected sectors in the less-developed provinces, while slightly increasing those effects in the developed provinces. Our results provide new information on the regional impacts of carbon tax based two different accounting principles with different tax revenue recycling scenarios."
The economics of identity: is China the new 'Japan problem' for the United States?,"Nymalm, Nicola",Journal of International Relations & Development,Palgrave Macmillan Ltd.,ECONOMICS; DISCOURSE analysis; INTERNATIONAL relations; ECONOMIC development; DEBATES & debating; CHINA; JAPAN,China; Discourse; Identity; Japan; Power shifts; US,"The 'rise of China' ranks among the most widely addressed contemporary topics in the field of International Relations. The majority of studies focuses on questions of 'power shifts' from West to East—in particular from the US to China—commonly premised on assessments of China's rapid economic growth. However, it is rarely taken into consideration that the last comparable debate was conducted only a few decades ago, when Japan was proclaimed the new 'Number One'. The neglect is even more remarkable given the striking similarities in the US discourses on first Japan and then China as not only an 'unfair economic player', but also a 'threat' to US global preeminence. In turn, the similarities seem puzzling given the differences in the bilateral relationship between the US and Japan in the past, and the US and China more recently. This article analyses parallels in these discourses by taking a view that goes beyond the economy as material capabilities and interests common in research on 'rising powers'. Instead, focusing on the role of identity, it contends that the similarities in articulating Japan and China as threats stem from them not adhering to the US model of liberal democratic capitalism, while being economically successful on their own terms."
The Effects of Media Use and Traditional Gender Role Beliefs on Tolerance of Homosexuality in China.,"Hu, Kang; Li, Xinling",Chinese Sociological Review,Taylor & Francis Ltd,INTERNET; CHINA; MASS media use; GENDER role; HOMOSEXUALITY,,"Using the Chinese General Social Survey (CGSS) data collected in 2015, this study investigates the effects of traditional media use and Internet use on tolerance of homosexuality, and the extent to which traditional gender role beliefs can moderate these effects. The results show that, while Internet use had a positive effect on tolerance of homosexuality, exposure to traditional media was likely to inhibit such tolerance. Moreover, traditional gender role beliefs are found to be able to undermine the liberalizing effect of Internet use on tolerance of homosexuality. The implications of the findings for understanding attitudes toward homosexuality in China are discussed."

It begins by engaging with the global discourse about ""new"" diplomacy and outlines how society-centric citizen diplomacy differs from state-centric public diplomacy. After revealing that European policy-makers are only reluctantly acknowledging the role of laymen in foreign policy-making vis-à-vis China, it shows that whilst citizen diplomacy may be a new concept in EU-China relations, it is actually not a new practice. The empirical part of the exegesis traces the experiential learning amongst 12 European citizen diplomats who have engaged China in the activity fields of disability; psychoanalysis; non-governmental organisation twinning; human rights; climate change mitigation; welfare of orphans, abandoned disabled children and young people; youth dialogue; public participation; animal welfare; and inclusive performing arts. The final part makes use of the newly developed hexagon of intercultural communication and collaboration competence to reveal how the European citizen diplomats have managed to navigate the sometimes-treacherous political-administrative landscape in mainland China. European citizen diplomats have made manifold and often surprising contributions to China's multifaceted development."
The emerging labour market and transformation from state amateurs to professional athletes.,"Liang, Yiyong",Communist & Post-Communist Studies,Elsevier B.V.,LABOR market; FOOTBALL; SPORTS,Chinese football; Chinese sport reform; Corporate governance; Football players in China; The football industry,Corporate governance and its associated concerns had no bearing on Chinese industry management before its national economic reform in the early 1980s. The government's intention has been to make all state-owned enterprises more effective and efficient than they previously were by gradually introducing Western enterprise methods with a capitalist market approach. The article explores the notion of corporate governance in the context of Chinese football by studying the emerging labour markets and management of professional football players to gain a comprehensive understanding of the issues concerning the governance of Chinese sports and its human resource management. It seeks to contribute to the development of stakeholder theory as an important analytical framework on Chinese management studies in the field of professional sport during its economic transition.
The empowerment of rural migrant lalas: Contending queerness and heteronormativity in China.,Tingting Liu,China Information,"Sage Publications, Ltd.",CHINA; HETERONORMATIVITY; SOCIAL role,digital media; heteronormativity; lesbian; media anthropology; queer; rural-to-urban migration,"In today's China, women's social roles continue to be rigidly associated with genderbased responsibilities that include defending the integrity of their family, entering into heteronormative marriage, and showing reproductive capabilities. Most of those who self-identify as lalas (lesbians) struggle with such issues as self-shaming emotions, disclosing their homosexuality to family members, friends, or colleagues, and dealing with family and social pressures. Within this context, I investigate queerness in a group of young Chinese rural migrant lalas working and living in the industrial area of the Pearl River Delta economic zone in South China. I draw two conclusions. First, rural-to-urban labour migration empowers rural female lalas by providing a measure of economic independence and an escape from patriarchal and homophobic family relations. Second, the integration of traditional (offline and face-to-face) socializing locations and emerging virtual communicative spaces plays an important role in the process through which possibilities of living a queer life are carved out."

Army; INTERMEDIATE-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (1987); CHINA-United States relations,arms control; China; INF Treaty; missiles; Russia,"Whereas much of the debate about the demise of the 1987 Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty has focused on the European context and Russia's alleged treaty violations, Asia looms large in the minds of proponents of the United States's immediate withdrawal from the treaty. For many proponents, the fast-changing military balance in Asia and China's conventionally armed missiles constitute a sufficient cause for withdrawal. What does the end of the INF Treaty bode for the US-China military balance? This article argues that, although there are some near-term benefits for the US position in the conventional military balance with China, the advantages offered by prohibited missiles are minor and can be readily substituted by extant capabilities that are compliant with the treaty. Given the negative implications of the end of the INF Treaty for the future of arms control, the costs and benefits of withdrawing from the treaty require further examination; the military balance in Asia is an unpersuasive rationale for withdrawing from an important part of the arms-control architecture."
The Enduring US-led Arms Embargo on China: An Objectives–Implementation Analysis.,"Evron, Yoram",Journal of Contemporary China,Taylor & Francis Ltd,"COLD War, 1945-1991; EMBARGO; SANCTIONS (International law); POLITICAL opportunity theory; COST effectiveness; CHINA-United States relations",,"Since the end of the Cold War, arms embargoes have typically been imposed on isolated and relatively weak states. Exceptionally, the 1989 US-led arms embargo on China is imposed on an influential world power that has various means to deal with it. Moreover, it has so far failed to change the behavior of and reduce arms imports by the targeted state—two basic parameters of arms embargo success. Attempting to explain the endurance of China arms embargo and building on the vast literature of international sanctions, the article closely examines the embargo's changing goals, costs, and implementation over the years. Arguing that the evolvement of these three components has kept the embargo cost-effective, the article enhances our understanding of the effectiveness of US China policy and concurrently illustrates the capacity of international sanctions to expose the true goal hierarchy, means, and political processes that underlie foreign policies."

We find that, over the past few years, the two countries have taken concrete steps to reinforce partnership in other strategic issue areas. Energy, in this respect, has been utilized as an effective policy instrument to deal with immediate challenges such as the Ukrainian crisis and the South China Sea disputes. We argue that cooperation in energy helps the two countries adopt common positions toward non-energy related issues and facilitate long-term deeper interaction. We thus maintain that energy will occupy an increasingly central position as China and Russia continue to seek to align their strategies more comprehensively against the backdrop of the evolving geopolitical environment by working to overcome existing disagreements and exploring new areas of cooperation."
The Enigma of Political Trust in China: Survey Response Patterns and Preferences for Redistribution.,"Lingnan He; Yang, Dali L.",Taiwan Journal of Democracy,Taiwan Foundation for Democracy,SURVEYS; POLITICAL psychology; TRUST; CHINA; RIDDLES; POLITICAL trust (in government),Inequality; political psychology; political trust; redistributive preference; survey response styles,"In the growing research on Chinese political behavior, it is well known that Chinese survey respondents tend to show high levels of political trust, especially political trust in the central party-state. Scholars have debated about how to make sense of these high political trust levels. In this study, we draw on data from multiple surveys to advance the debate by developing a more nuanced and dynamic understanding of political trust and distrust in contemporary Chinese contexts. We demonstrate the value of employing a more conceptually variegated typology of trust by showing that such an approach can shed new light on preferences for redistribution, and thus help advance the understanding of the relationship between political trust patterns and redistributive preference formation under authoritarianism."

But recent events have prompted optimism that the Chinese communities in both countries could move forward and claim their rightful place as equal citizens. But while the Indonesian Chinese community appears to have made some headway, the situation in Malaysia has not improved, and in some ways, it is worse. We argue that institutional frameworks and political Islam are the main threats to political rights for the Chinese communities in both countries and that there are lessons to be learned from these neighboring nations."

This paper argues that establishment of the China–Europe Landbridge predated the BRI and has been market‐driven, as service providers identified and responded to demand for efficient freight services along pre‐existing railway lines. Governments' role was trade facilitating, that is reducing delays and costs at border‐crossing points, rather than investing in hard infrastructure.

The Eurasian Landbridge provides a case study of servicification as a component of increased trade in the twenty‐first century."
The evolution of China's Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank: from a revisionist to status-seeking agenda.,"Wilson, Jeffrey D",International Relations of the Asia-Pacific,Oxford University Press / USA,DEVELOPMENT banks; CHINA; ASIAN Infrastructure Investment Bank; ASIAN Development Bank; WORLD Bank; ASIAN economic integration,,"China's Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) is a controversial addition to both the global and Asian economic architectures. Western critics have alleged it is a vehicle designed to achieve China's geostrategic goals, while scholars have argued it marks China's adoption of a 'revisionist' foreign policy strategy. This article argues that such interpretations are incorrect, as they fail to account for the evolution of China's AIIB agenda. To secure a broad membership and international legitimacy for the AIIB, China compromised with partners during governance negotiations in 2015. Western country demands saw several controversial initial proposals dropped, the governance practices of existing multilateral development banks were adopted, and cooperative partnerships were developed with the World Bank and Asian Development Bank. This transition from a revisionist to status-seeking AIIB agenda reveals the flexibility of Chinese economic statecraft, and its willingness to compromise strategic goals to boost the legitimacy of its international leadership claims."
The Evolution of Chinese Administrative Studies: Where Is the Field of Chinese Administrative Science Headed?,"Chow, King W.; Xu, Zhihang; Wen, Mingyue",Journal of Chinese Political Science,Springer Nature,PUBLIC administration; PUBLIC institutions; CHINA; DESIGN science; ONTOLOGY; CHINA -- Politics & government,Administrative science; Chinese public administration; Design science; Ontology; Optimal governance,"Is Public Administration (PA) as a field of study a basic science? If not, could PA generally and Chinese PA (CPA) in particular become a basic science or a design science? To address these questions, this essay reviews pertinent literature to underscore the major problems, basic deficiencies, and critical issues of CPA, and then reviews ongoing CPA research to shed light on its future development. Our review shows that PA lacks an intellectual core that defines the nature of public administration as a professional practice, and in turn, the nature of PA as an academic discipline. Further, while CPA bears the same deficiencies, it also suffers from three maladies, namely, reductionism, traditionalism, and conservatism, which together reinforce mediocrity. In view of all these issues and problems, where CPA is headed? Our literature review reports some ongoing research breakthroughs in CPA, including ontological confirmation of public administration nature and identification of necessary conditions for effective administrative results, which form a basis to suggest that CPA may become a basic science and design science."
The evolution of policy experimentation in China.,"Teets, Jessica C.; Hasmath, Reza",Journal of Asian Public Policy,Taylor & Francis Ltd,,China; Local officials; motivations for experimentation; policy innovation,"Scholars credit policy experimentation with China's economic reforms and authoritarian resilience. This article traces the evolution of experimentation through the prism of varying motivations, such as individual career incentives, improving governance, and symbolic and factional politics. Despite the benefits, there has been a notable reduction in experimentation under Xi Jinping, creating disincentives to innovate at the local level. Nevertheless, we do find remaining pockets of policy experimentation as a result of ineffective institutional incentives, influence of peer groups, and variations in the personalities of policymakers. However, it is unclear if this is robust enough for further economic or governance reforms."
"The Evolution of Private Provision in Urban Drinking Water: New Geographies, Institutional Ambiguity and the Need for Political Economy.","Powell, Jeff; Yurchenko, Yuliya",New Political Economy,Taylor & Francis Ltd,ECONOMICS; BALANCE of power; INTERNATIONAL relations; BERLIN (Germany); MUNICIPAL water supply; DRINKING water,privatisation; public services; remunicipalisation; urban drinking water; Water,"Empirical research paints a dynamic picture of the evolution of private provision in urban drinking water. A second wave of privatisation is clustered in a key group of countries, distinguished by the rise of new domestic private and quasi-private providers. This is, however, taking place in the presence of a counter-dynamic of remunicipalisation. In response to the complexity in provision arrangements revealed, three case studies are used to illustrate how different power balance configurations in the state-society-capital complex inform particular institutional arrangements. In Germany, civil society pressure challenged private capital resulting in the reinstatement of municipal control in Berlin, but at high long-term costs. In Russia, disempowered civil society has watched as the ruling regime exploits the support of international public agencies and foreign investors, while carefully safeguarding the interests of domestic private capital. In China, different levels of the state have promoted quasi-state actors into global corporations, managing the entry of international capital in order to bolster domestic support for desired political reforms. Public responsibility, and equally the re-assertion of public control after a period of private provision, may not in itself secure net social benefit where the right of capital to profit is put before broader social considerations."

Based on the analysis of official political discourses on the mass line, the Three Represents and more recent ongoing discourses on digitalization, we demonstrate the change and continuity of claim-making by the CCP. We show that while representative claim-making has undergone a significant transformation from the CCP as the representative of the working class to the sole representative of the Chinese people and nation, the CCP has been consistent throughout decades in maintaining its hegemony over representative claim-making."

It aims, first, to lay out the particular internal and external factors that have led to noticeable changes in the Philippines and Vietnam's SCS policies, and, second, to explore the implications of the ongoing shift in the regional politics for the East Asian strategic landscape. In this regard, two distinct tendencies with respect to geopolitical transformations are highlighted: while some actors are observed to put more emphasis on security and seek strategic diversification, others appear to put more emphasis on development and seek economic diversification."
The Financial Crisis and a Crisis of Expertise: A Chinese Genealogy of Neoliberalism.,"Dal Maso, Giulia",Historical Materialism,Brill Academic Publishers,NEOLIBERALISM; POLITICAL parties; CAPITALISM; FINANCIAL crises; FINANCIAL markets; CHINA,China; financial capitalism; financialisation; neoliberalism; stock market; technocracy,"The paper investigates the distinctly Chinese intertwining of expertise and state & financial capital to enrich the current understanding of neoliberalism as a hegemonic governing rationale. Since the summer of 2015, China has been experiencing one of its most severe financial crises since the adoption of a 'socialist market economy' in 1978. However, globally circulating narratives have failed to look beyond a Western-centric corollary, rehashing a critique of the Chinese one-party system and its lack of a 'genuine' free market. By exploring the specific genealogy of Chinese capitalism, and the distinctive Chinese financial-market structure, the article will show how the scientific authority of experts formulated amongst neoliberal thinkers never permeated the Chinese idea of knowledge. In the Chinese variety of financial capitalism, expertise is seen to lie not so much in the wisdom of individual experts as in their socio-political support, which legitimises their economic interventions."
The Financialisation of the State Sector in China.,"NAUGHTON, Barry",East Asian Policy,World Scientific Publishing Company,GOVERNMENT control; CHINA; FINANCIALIZATION; FINANCIAL instruments; HIGH technology industries,,"After the 2013 Third Plenum, China adopted a series of top-to-bottom policies that increased the importance of financial instruments, creating a hierarchy of funds that invest in state-owned and mixed ownership firms. These policies have been combined with increased government control and stress on high-technology industrial policies. The result has been an increasingly interventionist government, steering increasingly important state firms through financial instruments. It will take time before the Chinese government recognises the risks in creating a new wave of financial excesses."

In so doing, it examines on what basis these countries try to engage collectively with key Asian partners. A brief historical explanation might allow us to verify how non-legal elements have been politically and successfully networked with perfect timing. Policy convergence over strategies such us internationalization and negotiation was a milestone in the creation of the PA itself, presidentially led by Chile, Colombia and Peru. However, Chile and Peru share a pro-Pacific profile in economic and political terms, while Colombia's elites have traditionally ignored the Pacific Coast. These differences not necessarily impede on the articulation of a collective cooperation strategy with Asia-Pacific, but it might slow down the Chilean eagerness to reach prompt accords with Asian partners. This article suggests that taking non-legal factors into consideration might allow a wider understanding of the reasons behind economic alliances' formation. In so doing, International Political Economy' theoretical richness might fill the gap that International Economy Law has to explain such phenomena."

The foreign policy of Chile has been known for its consistency and continuity. The objective of this study is to analyse the foreign policy of Chile and what determines it. The questions to be answered in this paper are: how did Chile reinsert itself in the international arena following the violations of human rights in 1973? What determines the three main foreign policy objectives of Chile? How has consistency helped Chile in implementing all its foreign policy objectives and how should other nations, particularly Pakistan, follow the same pattern of continuity? Chile has shared very strong economic relations with the United States of America. China has been privileged to share one of its most prestigious relationships in Latin America, with Chile. This relationship shares several elements that differentiate it from other countries in Latin America. Chile's foreign policy framework is a good model for a country like Pakistan to learn from as both countries are situated in regions that have experienced conflict and dictatorships. The values and norms are similar to what Pakistan has and can help Pakistan relate better and learn how Chile distanced itself from a rule of autocracy and managed to rebuild its institutions, which have allowed Chile to transit from a developing economy to a developed economy."

While the impact of these pressures on individual alliances may vary, this system as a whole is expected to modify in three primary ways. Specifically, the San Francisco System is likely to become more diffused, selectively interconnected, as well as characterized by more insecurity toward the alliances on the part of both the United States and its allies. The worst‐case scenario for all U.S. regional allies would be being forced to choose between the United States and China. In this sense, the evolution of the U.S. hub‐and‐spokes system toward something that is more diffused and interconnected might, in the longer term, help allies to avoid such a situation amid increasing pressures."

THE GEOPOLITICAL LANDSCAPE OF EURASIA UNDER THE PRESSURE OF CASPIAN AND CENTRAL ASIAN POWER PROJECTS.,"ZHILTSOV, Sergey; ZONN, Igor; MARKOVA, Elena",Central Asia & the Caucasus (14046091),CA & CC Press AB,GEOPOLITICS; EURASIA; HYDROCARBONS,Caspian Pipeline Consortium; Central Asia; gas; infrastructural geopolitics; oil; the Caspian Region; Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India Pipeline (TAPI),"In the last ten years, the geopolitical situation in the Caspian region and Central Asia has been changing rapidly under the pressure of several factors, the main of them being energy projects realized, in particular, by non-regional states. Oil and gas transportation routes have become a strong instrument of geopolitical impact on the Central Asian and Caspian countries. Through their active involvement, the nonregional states, namely, the U.S., China, and the EU countries, have rechanneled the flows of hydrocarbons and changed the Eurasian geopolitical landscape. Having won this rivalry, China expanded the area of its geopolitical influence. The United States, which since the early 1990s has been working hard to turn the oil and gas flows away from Russia to the West came second. It changed the directions of Caspian hydrocarbon flows, while the greater part of Central Asian oil and gas is now moved to China. Beijing has become the key partner of the Central Asian and Caspian countries; it determines the nature of their cooperation in the energy sphere and, to a great extent, their foreign policy priorities. For geographical reasons, Central Asia and the Caspian are active on the regional energy market that comprises China, India and Russia. While the echo of the United States' ""shale revolution"" resounded all over the world and reached regional markets, the impact of Central Asian and Caspian fuels, extraction level and export routes is limited to Eurasia. It is no secret that the new pipelines undermined Russia's monopoly on oil and gas import and transit from Central Asia and the Caspian region, and that the local states nevertheless remain dependent on the policy pursued by their neighbors. Russia, which has preserved its influence in the region, shares its role of a consumer and a transitory territory with China, Turkey and Iran. India may join them at a later time. This makes the Central Asian countries fully dependent on the energy interests of these states, which do not hesitate to exploit the mechanism of price-formation and the volume of hydrocarbons bought to channel the policies of these countries. The local pipelines did not extinguish the fire of geopolitical rivalry and did not quench the interest of Russia, the U.S., China and Turkey, Iran and India in local hydrocarbon resources: they were used in the past and are used today as a powerful instrument of foreign policies. Another spiral of geopolitical rivalry in this part of the Eurasian space is coming closer: new pipelines have been practically completed, potential projects to be realized in the next few decades have been identified, while the regional states want to extract and sell the steadily increasing volumes of their hydrocarbons."

This study provides a comprehensive review of China's aid governance system and its evolution along the time, showing its changes and nonchanges. Path dependence effects are used to explain such evolution and are further illustrated by the consistent central role of the Ministry of Commerce in the aid system and by the central–provincial arrangement of development finance. Further, by exploiting limited yet novel evidence of the newly established State International Development Cooperation Agency, we argue that path dependence effects make it difficult to achieve the goal to comprehensively restructure the aid governance system by establishing State International Development Cooperation Agency. The study offers a useful perspective to understand the functioning and future evolution of China's aid governance system."

Pakistan was selected for the case study as one of the first destinations of Chinese FDi within the BRi, which allows necessary time distance for the research. its important geographical position at the new Silk Road traces, a significant amount of Chinese investment, and evidence of both positive and negative effects of Chinese penetration, are the additional reasons for choosing Pakistan for a case study. Using Multivariate Analysis methods, the impact of Chinese FDi and total FDi on several key economic indicators of Pakistan are measured and compared separately. The results show a much stronger and more positive impact of Chinese investment than total FDi but also point to the direction of a change, such as increasing of import, and potential challenges, such as external debt to China."

Problems related to housing are crucial in determining deprivation. By means of hierarchical linear regression on a representative survey of Hong Kong residents in 2014, this study examines the impacts of household income and housing factors on the deprivation of residents in Hong Kong. The study indicates that income level has a crucial effect on the deprivation level of households; whereas housing cost per capita, living area per capita, and living quarter problems significantly influence deprivation. A small interacting effect exists between household income and housing factors, which do not influence the independent effects of living area per capita and living quarter problems on deprivation. For the public rental housing residents, only the effect of living quarter problem on deprivation is significant, whereas for private rental housing residents, living area per capita and living quarter problem have a significant effect. Among all the models, housing expense per capita is a significant factor only in model for overcrowded households. The study recommends that improving the maintenance and renovation schemes for public and private housing with poor living environment is a good strategy to improve housing conditions and deprivation. The study suggests that anti‐poverty policies must consider strategies and measures that can improve the housing factors, including housing expenses, living density and living quarter maintenance problems, especially for those residents with high living density, such as those living in bed spaces, cubicles, and subdivided flats."

The empirical results show that China's policy support to key-industries through Five-Year Plans has had a significantly positive impact on its exports and trade balance. Specifically, this key-industry support policy has brought about a 0.35% increase in China's exports relative to imports since China's WTO accession, while this impact drops to 0.3% for the USA. Taking the foreign export controls into account, the impact of the key-industry support policy on China's trade surplus decreases significantly, which shows that the foreign export controls to China has magnified the impact of key-industry support policy on trade balance."

But in the past, alumni from other elite universities, such as Peking University and Renmin University of China, also occupied positions as senior cadres, so Tsinghua did not have any more influence than they did. However, since 2002, Tsinghua University has developed a 'cultivation/transfer' system whereby the school, in a purposeful, calculating, and organized manner, selects and trains talented students and then places them in political posts after graduation. After these students enter officialdom, they strengthen their ties with other alumni through their connections with the Tsinghua authorities and the Tsinghua Alumni Association. With this system in place, Tsinghua alumni account for the majority of 'post-1980 generation' county-level leading cadres. The authors therefore predict that the 'Tsinghua clique' will gain even stronger political influence, and Tsinghua University will likely become the most significant university for cultivating senior cadres."

China should enact an anti-discrimination law to transform international law into Chinese domestic law. Employment or occupational discrimination should be added as grounds for legal action. Reversal of burden of proof should be applied in the trial of the cases concerning equal right of labor, and compensation for emotional damage as well as punitive damages as remedies for the victims should be provided for. Efficiency of labor arbitration and administrative labor supervision should be strengthened in eliminating gender discrimination in employment or occupation."

Income inequality could impinge on future development, leading to social tension or political instability. Our study investigates the short‐run and long‐run relationship between three important macroeconomic indicators—income inequality, economic growth and financial depth. We utilise a two‐step procedure of ARDL bounds and Granger causality for the analysis. The bounds test indicates the presence of a cointegrating relationship between income inequality, financial depth and economic growth in the long run. In the second step, we utilise the Granger causality approach. Results show a bidirectional causality between financial depth‐growth and a unidirectional causality between inequality‐growth in the short run. In the long run, results reveal that growth and financial depth determine Gini. Our findings provide support for the inequality‐widening effect due to economic growth and higher credit provided to the private sector. We find no evidence of inequality‐narrowing or income‐equalising effect in the long run for the period of study. It is possible that the government's inclusive growth policies which started less than a decade ago have not taken effect for us to capture the inverted U‐shape income equalising effect significantly."

The Initiation of the Sino-Indian rivalry.,"Pardesi, Manjeet S.",Asian Security,Taylor & Francis Ltd,"SINO-Indian Border Dispute, 1957-; CHINA-India relations",,"Sino-Indian interactions after the mid-19th century had a causal influence on Chinese and Indian elite perceptions. Modern China encountered modern India as an agent of British imperialism. China perceived India as an ""imperial"" power in the late 1940s by resorting to the availability heuristic while doubting India's intentions in Tibet/Southeast Asia. By contrast, India viewed China as a fellow victim of colonialism that had sought India's help during World War II. Consequently, India perceived China as a ""partner"" in postwar/postcolonial Asia. This interpretation was based on confirmation bias after 1947, despite contradictory Chinese signals. India's image of China changed only after the 1950–51 invasion/annexation of Tibet. India then ascribed the image of an ""expansionist/hegemonic"" power to China based on historical analogy. Nevertheless, they carefully calibrated their strategies towards each other in consonance with these images until the 1959 Lhasa Uprising, thereby preventing their relationship from descending into militarized hostilities."
The innovative personality?

This study suggests that policy experimentation in this institutional environment can best be understood as an interaction between the structure in which local officials are embedded and individual‐level personality attributes. Leveraging a new data set from a series of original surveys with local policy makers in mainland China, conducted between 2016 and 2018, we discern three baseline personality types: authoritarian, consultative, and entrepreneurial. We thereafter examine the individual‐level characteristics of local officials who will innovate irrespective of a centralization of bureaucratic power and interests, as currently experienced under Chinese President Xi Jinping. We find that local policy makers engage in policy innovation when they are more focused on resolving governance problems and that increased risk reduces but does not eliminate their willingness to innovate. Based on these findings, we contend that future studies of policy innovation should use an evolutionary framework to examine the interaction between preferences and selection pressures."

Through a comparative case study of the institutionalization of the Asia–Pacific vs the Indo-Pacific, we argue that two crucial factors contributed to the slow institutionalization of the Indo-Pacific as a regional system in world politics: the lack of ideational leadership from an epistemic community and the weak executive leadership from a powerful state. While ideational leaders can help states identify and expand common interests in cooperation, executive leadership will facilitate states to overcome operational obstacles in cooperation, such as the 'collective action' problem and the 'relative gains' concern. The future of institution-building in the Indo-Pacific will depend on whether and how these two leadership roles are played by scholars and states in the region. In the conclusion, we discuss the challenges of institutionalizing the Indo-Pacific and highlight China as a wild card in the future of Indo-Pacific regionalism."
The international appeal of behavioural public policy: is nudge an Anglo-American phenomenon?,"John, Peter",Journal of Chinese Governance,Taylor & Francis Ltd,GOVERNMENT policy; INTERNATIONAL relations; PUBLIC administration; NUDGE theory; BEHAVIORAL economics,Behavioural public policy; diffusion; nudge,"Since the publication of Nudge by Thaler and Sunstein (2008) behavioural public policies and nudge units have been widely adopted right across the world, which has resulted in many improvements to the delivery of public policies, such as better tax collection, increased access of young people to education opportunities, and more charitable giving. This paper asks what explains the adoption of nudge units and related initiatives. In particular, are Anglo–American or West European countries the focus for adoption? Are these interventions more likely to appear under left, right, or centre-dominated governments? Ascertaining the origins of nudge can adjudicate the extent to which nudge is partial project, based on the dominance of liberal economies and the preferred programme for centre governments and/or right political ideologies, or whether it has more universal appeal. Using data from OECD and OECD-partner countries, event history models reveal Anglo–American countries to be the drivers, with nudge not favoured by left-controlled governments. Nonetheless, with the interest and level of policy transfer not abating, in future years nudge is likely to appear in a wide variety of contexts, including China."
The International Politics of Reactive Currency Statecraft: Japan's Reaction to the Rise of the Chinese Renminbi.,"Chey, Hyoung-kyu",New Political Economy,Taylor & Francis Ltd,MONEY; POLITICAL science; PRACTICAL politics; CHINESE; ASIANS,Currency internationalisation; financial statecraft; international currency; Japan; renminbi internationalisation,"This study analyses how a state's reactive currency statecraft – its strategic reaction to an international currency issued by a foreign state – is shaped, by devoting special attention to its broad foreign policy stance towards the state issuing that international currency, with a main empirical focus on the Japanese case with regard to the Chinese renminbi. This research argues that a state uses its policy related to a foreign international currency as a diplomatic means of managing its political relationship with the state issuing that currency, while also showing that in general most market actors are not greatly interested in their governments' policies regarding foreign international currencies, especially those that are newly internationalising ones. This study finds as well that the conventional notion of 'competition' between international currencies does not necessarily affect a state's reactive currency statecraft, even if its own currency is a major international one. All of this suggests that the inter-state politics between the state issuing an international currency and foreign states does have a crucial impact on the currency's international use, especially during its early stages of internationalisation. It also implies that a state's reactive currency statecraft can be fluid, depending upon the directions of its foreign policy."

It analyzes the sociodemographic structure of the population, the dynamics of the number of young people, as well as the dynamics and composition of the country's school in the country. There is also an examination of the ways in which the process of emigration from Iran had evolved in the context of the country's socio-political history of the state in the 20th-21st centuries. Various levels of the Iranian education system are considered. The author examines the internationalization trends in higher education. The forms and trends of academic mobility, including exit and entry mobility, are delineated. In recent years, the visiting academic mobility of Iranian students has been targeted at the U.S., Turkey, Italy, Canada, and the UAE. There is a contemplation of the methods used for selecting Iranian students for studying abroad at the state budget's expense, which is based on a system of state quotas and fairly high requirements for applicants. Iranian students studying abroad receive an academic scholarship. Those who receive such a scholarship must pay a deposit before being issued a final permit, and commit to returning to Iran after graduation and working for up to six years. Recently, increasing the number of foreign students in Iran has become one of the priorities of the Ministry of Science, Research and Technology. The admission of foreign students has presently become one of the most important tasks undertaken by universities. One way to attract more foreign students and compete for them is to raise the status of universities and the country. Iran is growing more attractive as a recipient of international students from certain neighboring countries (Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Pakistan, and China). The role of academic mobility in the integration of Iran into the international educational and scientific space and the contribution of academic exchanges to the development of the national culture of Iran are emphasized."

In contrast, many good‐performing countries such as Malaysia have been middle‐income countries for several decades despite relatively strong growth and a substantial improvement in education and export sophistication. We argue that the key factor differentiating the Asian miracles from economies like Malaysia is the creation of technologies by domestic firms and leapfrogging to the technological frontier at an early stage of development. Sophisticated tradable manufacturing and high‐tech innovation sectors offer opportunities for local technology creation, high potential spillovers, and sustainable growth and employment."
The Likelihood of Cyberwar between the United States and China: A Neorealism and Power Transition Theory Perspective.,"Akdag, Yavuz",Journal of Chinese Political Science,Springer Nature,INFORMATION warfare; CYBERTERRORISM -- Government policy; GOVERNMENT policy; CHINA-United States relations; CYBERSPACE operations (Military science),Cyberwar; Neorealism; Power parity; Power transition theory; Satisfaction,"The studies addressing cyberwar and depicting electronic doomsday scenarios, such as cyber version of 9/11, are immensely policy-driven. They lack a theoretical rigor in their explanations, causing a theory-policy gap in the study of cyberwar. This gap is more acute in the discussion on cyberwar scenarios between China and the United States (U.S). Additionally, while some used neorealist frameworks to understand the nature of U.S-China relations in cyberspace, they did so mostly with no systematic analysis of the likelihood of cyberwar between the two. I intend to bridge this theory-policy gap by examining the prospect of cyberwar between the U.S. and China using Neorealism and Power Transition Theory (PTT). I argue that PTT offers a more useful framework. Applying PTT indicates that while cyberwar currently seems unlikely, China will become cyberwar-prone to switch the status quo in cyberspace to its favor, especially if it achieves offensive cyberwar capability parity with the U.S. while simultaneously remaining dissatisfied with the cyber order. I utilized secondary empirical sources in the relevant literature in conducting this study."

Existing studies have primarily evaluated these unintended consequences in democracies but not in autocracies. To fill this gap, we investigate the variations of local public service delivery in a decentralized autocracy: China. Specifically, we argue that local politicians possess two sources of de facto political power: Political connection with higher-ranking officials and the mobilization capacity of local political actors. When political connection is absent and local politicians face strong local political rivals, they are incentivized to use public spending as a patronage strategy to garner local political support in order to assure political survival. We draw evidence from an original county-level dataset in China that contains itemized education spending data."
The Logic of Fragmented Activism among Chinese State-Owned Enterprise Workers.,"Chen, Xi",China Journal,University of Chicago Press,ACTIVISM; COLLECTIVE action; PRIVATIZATION; SOLIDARITY; SOCIOECONOMICS; CHINA,,"One of the fundamental weaknesses of popular collective action in China is a lack of broad-based solidarity. This article examines the collective protests by workers at state-owned enterprises when many of them were restructured from the mid-1990s through the mid-2010s, which often led to downsizing, closures, or privatization. The article draws on interviews conducted with retirees and laid-off workers from 91 restructured state-owned enterprises in a city in Hunan Province, plus an in-depth case study of one factory there. The evidence shows that the local state was able to fragment labor activism not only by using intimidation and coercion to prevent broad-based mobilization but also by creating incentives for workers to pursue narrow identities and particularistic claims. This explains why the workers' mobilization was often counterproductive—rather than building up group solidarity, their mobilization tended to divide and demoralize workers' communities. The study examines the nature of the divisions between worker groups and shows which specific types of groups were able to persevere and which types were able to transcend a single firm in their claims. This article also indicates that divisions between worker groups were not always predetermined by socioeconomic cleavages but instead often resulted from workers' interactions with the government and with each other. The findings provide insights into the limits of popular collective action in China."

It illustrates how, in the years leading up to the war, Britain's colonial legacy in the Indian subcontinent saw it drawn reluctantly into a territorial dispute between Asia's two largest and most powerful nations. It analyses disagreements in Whitehall between the Foreign Office and Commonwealth Relations Office over the relative strength of India and China's border claims, and assesses how these debates reshaped British regional policy. It argues that the border war was instrumental in transforming Britain's post-colonial relationship with South Asia. Continuing to filter relations with India through an imperial prism proved unsatisfactory, what followed was a more pragmatic Indo-British association."

Marx had his own rendering of the critique of the commodity, in fact a revolutionary critique of the commodity which was not 'outside the worthless commodity', but in 'confronting the worthless commodity', a confrontation that begins with his celebrated Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844 and then which went to the Grundrisse, the three volumes of Capital, the three parts of Theories of Surplus Value and Notes on Adolf Wagner. Marx discovered a new site that lay beyond the commodity principle which he christened 'a community of free individuals'. Two hundred years after Marx's birth we remember him as the seeker of these free individuals. We also remember him as the trenchant critique of all class societies, nationalism and of human alienation in general. However, we also remember him as the one who wrote the dirge of Stalinism well before Stalin was born, the elegy of the myth of 'socialism in one country' and mainly the requiem of the horrible myth of the socialist commodity (both which were the core parts of the ideology of Stalin and the Soviet Union, of Mao and Maoist China and which is now the principal myth of China). This essay is about going beyond the worthless commodity and how humanity needs to understand the transcendence of this worthlessness. Marx's critique of political economy and his theory of value is a critique of the worthless commodity. And it is in this site of the critique of political economy that his idea of revolutionary philosophy emerges."
The making and remaking of ecological space in China: The political ecology of Chongming Eco-Island.,"Xie, Linjun; Flynn, Andrew; Tan-Mullins, May; Cheshmehzangi, Ali",Political Geography,Elsevier B.V.,POLITICAL ecology; SUSTAINABLE development; URBAN planning; ECONOMIC development & the environment; CHONGMING Island (China),Chongming Eco-Island; Eco-development; Ecological modernization; Political ecology; Urban sustainability,"Abstract This paper contributes to debates on urban sustainable development through a critical examination of current state-led and Ecological Modernization-guided eco-developments in China. Using Chongming Eco-Island as a case study, we critically evaluate the practices and effects of current development practices alongside ecological, economic, and social dimensions. Adopting an alternative analytical approach – political ecology, our analysis brings to the fore a host of stakeholders' voices and knowledge (especially the often-marginalized grassroots), triangulated with archival research and on-site observation. Our findings show that the Eco-Island development with an Ecological Modernization bias generates unintended and adverse results for the local community and the environment. We argue that political ecology, as both a contesting perspective in sustainable development and as a critical analytical method in understanding society-environment relations, serves as an attractive alternative strategy for those seeking to analyze a more nature-focused, locally-relevant means to promote just planning for urban sustainability."

In other words, the military tapestry has become a landmark for the whole MENA region. In its binary expression -- conceptually and pragmatically -- this phrase has become a syntagma whose meaning goes far beyond the function of a mere metaphor. It is indicative that this very domain has not ceased to be a major, if not the main, actor in today's MENA & Arabs drama. And that with a panoply of consequential actions on the ground, from instilling an ever-stronger overdosing of authoritarianism in a society already marked by a contained space for the rule of law and freedom of expression, to what one can witness as openly violent and destructive conflicts, themselves in different manifestations, from intrastate civil wars, to ethnic cleansings or to inter-state wars, direct or proxy or hybrid. The paradigm is further complicated by outside forces jockeying for geopolitical influence and resources control in the MENA region, especially in the Arab realm: the external unrestrained involvement in the area's problems, directly or by proxy too, essentially military in nature and intrinsically interwoven with the national and local army dimensions, mostly with no less an unfortunate impact on the host territories and populations. Dealing now just with the ""Arab sector"" Cluster/ Constellation of MENA's contemporary Military Tapestry, from a general perspective (PART I) and from a national/ country perspective (PART II), the present paper has a dual purpose, first, to provide a structural taxonomy of the basic conceptual and pragmatic ways guiding in-roads into such a subject-matter of extreme ramification, so that to reach a perception as holistic as possible, from a 'civilian deck' and inherently personal, not ignoring the military dimensions of the involvement in MENA's affairs by those outside powers having strong interests in the region -- United States, Russia, Turkey, China, as well as the new military dimension of the region and the competing one with the 'official' Military, namely the non-state armed actors, second, to deal more circumstantially with the Arabs' armies, as peculiar contributors to the military tapestry of today's MENA."

One influential group of actors at the grassroots level were the so-called 'continental adventurers' (tairiku rōnin)—Japanese nationals who travelled in Korea and China on the lookout for adventures and employment opportunities. Some of them worked part time for the army as spies, translators, and agents for special operations. These adventurers have been studied before as agents of Japanese imperialism, but existing accounts fail to present a convincing model of the mechanism that made their activities effective. The goal of this article is to fill this gap. This mechanism, which I shall hereafter call 'the military-adventurous complex', was a lobby of officers, continental adventurers, businessmen, politicians, criminal elements as well as Chinese, Manchurian, and Mongolian revolutionaries. The interests of these contingents were unique but nevertheless intertwining. Despite its decentralized character, the military-adventurous complex had a significant impact on Japanese foreign policy over an extended period. In this article, we shall explore the contours, structure, and modus operandi of that complex, its ambivalent relationship with the Japanese state, as well as several examples of its operations in the early twentieth century. Finally, we shall dwell on the ramifications of the complex on the development of Japanese imperialism."
"The moment when Peking fell to the Japanese: a ""horizontal"" perspective.","Yidan, YUAN",Journal of Modern Chinese History,Taylor & Francis Ltd,,anti-Japanese war; everyday life; Fall of Peking,"Due to its equivocal character, the fall of Peking in 1937 was a historical moment that deserves a thorough revisit focusing on the city's multifaceted structure. As a narrative strategy, ""moment"" aims at putting various spatial imageries of multiple events in a minimized temporal unit. This article focuses on two moments after the Marco Polo Bridge incident of July 7, 1937: July 29, when the Chinese troops withdrew from Peking, and August 8, when the Japanese troops entered the city. It reconstructs these historical scenarios by utilizing the reports of journalists, diary entries, and reminiscences, along with literary works to capture the moment of Peking's fall. Using a ""horizontal"" perspective, this paper reveals Peking residents' communal awareness and attempts to excavate nationalist elements from local experiences."

From a theoretical viewpoint, this research contributes to the literature on interstate rivalry from multiparty perspective, which has been overlooked in existing research. China–Japan–US complex interstate rivalry includes elements of positional, spatial and ideological rivalry simultaneously. When rivalries mix two or more rivalry types, they become more difficult to resolve. The two broad trends of China's military build-up and deepening US–Japan alliance evolve in tandem intensifying rivalry dynamics and increasing positional elements of rivalry. There are many indications on various levels that for China, controlling Japan's international ambitions has become less important and more attention is paid to ways in which Japan helps the United States in reaching its objectives in Asia through their alliance agreement. The cases analysed to display complex interstate rivalry include the Taiwan question, territorial disputes in the East and South China Seas, and the North Korean nuclear issue."

After the government declared the ANC illegal, Mandela helped to supervise the programme called the M-Plan, in order to lay the groundwork for mass participation in an anticipated revolutionary transformation, but the effort did not succeed. Members resisted the M-Plan reorganisation on the ground; the state assaulted the ANC and its leaders, and ripped apart communities; and the leadership denied Mandela full access to the ANC in his preparations for the violence he saw ahead of them. He was allowed to form a separate group, relying on the South African Communist Party and port city trade unionists for its organising. That smaller network, Umkhonto, was grafted into the M-Plan hierarchy a year later, problematically and partially, too little, too late."

However, these works rarely separate hukou's social impacts from those caused by the changes in the economic system itself. With a review of historical policy documents, data on migration from rural to urban sectors, agricultural output and industrial output growth, I argue that hukou is in fact a rather neutral and passive legislation in the sense that it can perform opposite functions depending on the particular economic system it is operating under. This paper calls for bringing the concept of economic system back to the center of the discussion regarding development models. JEL Classification: O15, D63"

As protests grow steadily in both scale and frequency, the government continues to tout social stability as the chief concern of China today. These mounting tensions reflect a direct clash of horns between the maintenance of stability and the public's desire to exercise their rights, frequently culminating in acts of repression by the Chinese state in order to quell the unrest. This raises an important question: how can the relationship between repression and popular protest in China be characterized? More specifically, which precise circumstances of popular protest elicit the employment of China's repressive state capacity? Taking into account both theoretical perspectives and empirical analysis, this paper attempts to elucidate the issue by first collating a large body of data to clarify the precise characteristics of popular protest, then undertaking quantitative analysis to identify which factors trigger the mobilization of China's machinery of repression. Furthermore, this study identifies that in recent years, the use of state repression has risen in parallel with an increasing emphasis on the principle of ""maintaining social stability"" in China."

We know less about their day‐to‐day activities and if (and if so why) they are being innovative in the field of multilateral development lending. This article evaluates novelty in the two banks. It uncovers and suggests an explanation to the puzzle of why the NDB appears more innovative (in terms of institutional design, staffing, and lending policy guidelines) than the AIIB by exploring the cases of China and Brazil. The two countries played central roles in the set‐up of each the AIIB and NDB. Drawing on extensive field research, the article proposes that their preferences and capability to engage in institutional innovation depend on interests, status, economic power, and regulatory capacity."

It concludes that China as an ascending power shows no tendency to completely break away from the current international system. Instead, China seeks opportunities within the system, which it uses to support its economic and political interests. This approach brings multiplicative effects for other aspects of China's performance in international institutions, eg. compensating for the normative criticism it has attracted."
The New Development Bank and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank: China's Ambiguous Approach to Global Financial Governance.,"Wang, Hongying",Development & Change,Wiley-Blackwell,DEVELOPMENT banks; BRETTON Woods System; NEW Development Bank; ASIAN Infrastructure Investment Bank; DEVELOPMENT credit corporations,,"The creation of the New Development Bank (NDB) and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) has generated a great deal of attention and controversy in the development community and beyond. Do these banks indicate that China is promoting a new model of multilateral development finance that undermines the existing system dating back to Bretton Woods? What are the forces shaping China's policy choices in this area? In contrast to the prevailing tendency to view these banks as part and parcel of the same challenge or opportunity for multilateral development financing, this article highlights major distinctions between the NDB and the AIIB. The fact that China is playing a prominent role in both the NDB and the AIIB suggests that China is not promoting a coherent new model of multilateral development financing, but is instead straddling different traditions in this realm of global financial governance. The ambiguity in China's approach to multilateral development finance is shaped by its multiple identities and complex economic and political interests."

The official reappraisal of May Fourth intellectuals: Hu Shi in the Sinicization of Marxism.,"Orly, Selena",China Information,"Sage Publications, Ltd.","MARXIST philosophy; MAY Fourth movement, China, 1919; HU, Shi, 1891-1962",CCP legitimacy; establishment intellectuals; Hu Shi; Maoism; May Fourth; Sinicization of Marxism,"In the two decades after 1995, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) executed a significant philosophical shift in its relentless struggle for legitimacy and relevance through the Sinicization of Marxism (马克思主义中国化). Following the pattern of many other political reorientations, the party undertook a reassessment of a prominent historical figure to conduct ideological work – in this case, a leading May Fourth intellectual, Hu Shi. For decades the orthodox CCP view of Hu had been uniformly negative, but from 1995 onwards the People's Republic of China's establishment intellectuals presented a more positive appraisal of his impact on Chinese history. Previous scholarship on the rehabilitation of Hu argues that the shift reflected the more liberal academic and political climate of the times. This article argues however that the reappraisal of Hu enabled the CCP to manage a key problem in its political identity – the disjuncture between revolutionary Maoism and reform-era policies captured by the slogan 'socialism with Chinese characteristics'. By analysing the discussion on a key 1919 debate – known as the 'problems and isms' debate – I show that the CCP used Hu's philosophical ruminations to trace the Sinicization of Marxism from the moment Marxism entered China to reform-era socialism with Chinese characteristics, and in the process it diminished the role of revolutionary Maoism.

Despite much research on the topic over the past two decades, there continues to be a lack of consensus on the efficacy of reforms implemented since then. While some have focused on persisting patterns of paternalism, others have highlighted the structural changes implemented. This article revisits this debate by analysing the ways in which culture influences the implementation of structural reforms as a legitimating ideology. By analysing ethnographic data of a chaebol subsidiary in Beijing, the article demonstrates how cultural tropes of the company as a family and women as caretakers, popularised under the Park Chung Hee regime, have continued to shape perceptions of competence in the workplace. In particular, despite the crucial role that Korean Chinese employees have played in helping the chaebol penetrate Chinese markets, their bilingual and bicultural skills are devalued. Instead, the feminisation of their labour has justified their continuing marginalisation in the firm."
The Paris Agreement on Climate Change—Made in USA?,"Milkoreit, Manjana",Perspectives on Politics,Cambridge University Press,SOCIAL constructionism; PARIS Agreement (2016); CLIMATE change,,"The 2015 Paris Agreement established a new logic for international climate governance: the pledge-and-review system. In 2009, the same idea had been proposed in the Copenhagen Accord, but was then forcefully rejected by the negotiation community. Explaining this turnaround, I analyze the role of the United States in the international climate negotiations, using Putnam's two-level game framework and Snidal's k-group theory. U.S. domestic politics imposed significant constraints on the terms of the Paris Agreement, contributing to the emergence of the new treaty architecture. Until 2015, U.S. negotiators were either unable or unwilling to bring the demands of political actors at the domestic and international levels in alignment. President Obama achieved this alignment in 2015 by creating international support for a treaty without legally binding obligations that could circumvent a Congressional ratification barrier. The latter required a surprising move: the proactive engagement of China despite the structural context of hegemonic transition."

The Peculiarities of Traditional Marriage Rituals of the Dungan Diaspora: A Comparative-Historical Analysis.,"Imyarova, Zulfiya",Nationalities Papers,Cambridge University Press,RITES & ceremonies; KAZAKHSTAN; MARRIAGE customs & rites; DUNGANS; MARRIAGE service,China; Dungan diaspora; Muslims; traditional marriage rituals,"This article, through comparative historical analysis, examines the traditional marriage rituals of the Dungan diaspora in Kazakhstan. Dungans are Chinese-speaking Muslims who were forced to migrate to present-day Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Uzbekistan after the defeat of their revolt against the Qing dynasty from 1877 to 1888. The article focuses on the diversity of wedding ceremonies in three zones where Dungan settled in Kazakhstan: Zhalpak Tobe and Sortobe, two rural areas in the Zhambyl region; and Zaria Vostok, near the city of Almaty. I find that the local variations in traditional wedding ceremonies stem from their close intercultural and social cooperation with non-Dungan peoples—primarily Kazakhs, Uzbeks, Uyghurs, and Russians. The example of wedding rituals shows that, while Dungan existence in another cultural environment has stimulated the consolidation of their ethnic group, preserving many of the traditional archaic cultural features, it has also led to the transformation of the marriage ceremonies. I address a much-neglected pathway—the nature of borrowed elements in Dungan wedding rituals—and ask why the extent of borrowing varies from community to community even though the Dungan arrived from China with similar traditions."

Among the many important aspects of this effort is the establishment of the PLA Rocket Force (PLARF). Creation of the PLARF solidified China's missile forces as a critical element of China's evolving strategic deterrent posture, portends continued significant investment in PLARF modernisation, and points to a more concerted effort to integrate PLARF capabilities into more effective PLA-wide joint operations—all key developments in the fundamental reshaping of China's approach to strategic deterrence. These developments will affect U.S. strategic and extended deterrence postures, U.S.-China strategic stability, allied conventional force operations, information dominance and security, critical infrastructure, and other key aspects of national security. This study details the organisational, technological, and doctrinal changes afoot for the PLARF, and analyses how—if successful—they affect U.S. and U.S-allied military strategy in the Indo-Pacific region."
"The Perils of Hubris? A Tragic Reading of ""Thucydides' Trap"" and China-US Relations.","Zhang, Biao",Journal of Chinese Political Science,Springer Nature,INTERNATIONAL relations; POWER (Social sciences); BALANCE of power; CHINA-United States relations; FEAR,China-US relations; Fear; Hubris; Power transition; Thucydides' trap; Tragedy,"In the last few years, Graham Allison's ""Thucydides' Trap"" has stimulated much discussion within International Relations (IR). Most IR scholars understand Thucydides' Trap as a shorthand for power transition theory, and view it as highly inadequate for analyzing China-US relations. This article seeks to offer an alternative, tragic, understanding of Thucydides' Trap that may have more purchase on the analysis of the dynamic of China-US relations. It first argues that while Thucydides' Trap shares power transition theory's focus on the shifting balance of power, it is also different from the latter in its emphasis on the emotional implications of changes in the balance of power. This article then explores a tragic understanding of Thucydides' Trap. Economic success often encourages a rising power to display ambition, confidence and enhanced sense of self (what Allison calls ""rising power syndrome""), which leads to loosened restraint, overextension, and strategic blunder; meanwhile, its assertive and ambitious moves spark a ruling power's fear, insecurity and even paranoia (what Allison calls ""ruling power syndrome""), which prompts it to take ""preventive"" actions in response to the rising power's assertiveness. This article finally looks at China-US relations through this tragic lens. It suggests that this tragic understanding of Thucydides' Trap can illuminate the emotional aspect of China-US relations, and also argues that the Thucydides Trap Research Project should henceforth develop an emotional line of inquiry into interaction between the great powers."

In the case of Malaysia, the eventual outcome of this interaction is dependent on three key conditions: fulfilment of Malaysia's longstanding pro-ethnic Malay policy, a mutual vision between the state and federal authorities, and advancement of geopolitical interests for both Malaysia and China. The article puts forward a typology illustrating various possible outcomes to examine the interconnections between key players at a time of Chinese ascendancy."

Aid allocation within countries is often thought of as a strategic action by the incumbent leaders to further their own goals. Theoretically, however, the effects of aid may be either positive or negative and the empirical evidence is limited. By matching geo-coded data on aid projects to 101 792 respondents in five waves of the Afrobarometer, we investigate the effects of aid on incumbency support using project fixed effects. We estimate the effects for World Bank aid and Chinese aid separately and find positive effects for the former and no robust effect for the latter. For neither project donor do we find effects on turnout and that aid is not targeting areas with previously higher incumbency support. We find little support for the notion that economic voting is driving the result as individuals self-perceived economic conditions are not affected. The positive effects for the World Bank aid projects seem to be mediated by trust in the politicians, whereas we find no effects of Chinese aid on trust."

The United States and the United Kingdom did not provide the required financial assistance to Burma during the post-war years, even though Burma urgently needed assistance to advance the Pyidawtha plan and was unexpectedly facing a drastic decrease in paddy export income. Following the instability and crisis in socioeconomic reform and development, Burma requested additional assistance from China and other sources. Although Burma faced pressure from the left wing, particularly from the Burmese Communist disturbance, Burma became increasingly interested in cooperating with China. China established a policy giving Burma a Chinese diplomatic exit and provided, along with the Soviet Union, timely economic aid."
The Politics of Latin America's Investment and Other Links with China: Contextualizing the Region's Cash Chasing while Racking Richer Research Rewards.,"Blanchard, Jean-Marc F.",Journal of Chinese Political Science,Springer Nature,FOREIGN investments; ECONOMIC policy; POLITICAL change; CHINESE investments; CHINA -- Foreign economic relations; LATIN America; CARIBBEAN Area,China; Chinese outward foreign direct investment; Latin America; Political economy of national security; United States,"There are three positions about the impact of outward foreign direct investment (FDI) from China on the policies of Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) countries: the ""Wealth is Power"" camp, which associates political power with Chinese economic lures; the ""Conditionalist"" camp, which contends the international and domestic economic and political context determines the specific political effect of Chinese outward FDI (OFDI); and the ""Politics is Power"" camp, which believes no dramatic political changes have resulted from the economic stimuli of Chinese OFDI (COFDI) and associated economic lures. Case studies herein on Brazil and China, Argentina and China, Ecuador and China, and the Caribbean and China support the Conditionalist camp, albeit to differing degrees and for different reasons. Case studies herein on COFDI in Argentina and in Colombia also deepen our knowledge about the drivers of COFDI. They challenge those asserting that COFDI in LAC is driven purely by political motives. This piece also reviews and critiques the state of the literature on COFDI in LAC and suggests a pathway for moving to the next level. It specifically recommends researchers work to cumulate knowledge by asking similar kinds of questions across cases, exploit theory, and work on variable conceptualization and operationalization."

The Politics of Wrongful Convictions in China.,"Zhong, Lena Y.; Dai, Mengliang",Journal of Contemporary China,Taylor & Francis Ltd,CRIMINAL justice system; PUBLIC support; DEFENSE (Criminal procedure); CHINA; ACTUAL innocence; DEFENDANTS; EYEWITNESS identification,,Recently a series of high-profile wrongful convictions in China have undermined public confidence with the criminal justice system and the official stress on 'ruling the country by law'. This article aims to further the scholarship on wrongful convictions in China by investigating the characteristics of 141 erroneous convictions (206 defendants) in which the defendants are declared factually innocent by a court. These cases allow an examination of the direct contributing factors (such as mistaken eyewitness identification and forensic errors) and underlying political factors (such as the form of political-legal work as led by the Party/State and the political importance in maintaining social stability) for wrongful conviction in China. The analysis enables us to develop more effective countermeasures against wrongful conviction in the Chinese context.

Focusing on both the material and discursive construction of the so-called stockpile in the early 1940s, the work seeks to deconstruct a powerful symbol that was long used by both British and American officials (particularly in the US War Department) to delegitimize the Nationalist government's war effort against Japan. Drawing on sources collected at archives in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Taiwan, the article seeks to rethink many commonly held assumptions about American aid and to reveal the powerful influence that the symbolic presence of the stockpile had in shaping Sino-American relations in the wartime period and beyond."

This work took place just as the American Bureau for Medical Aid to China discussed plans to establish an American pilot plant for Chinese penicillin manufacture, which would directly transfer technologies and personnel from the US to China. While American advisers saw the basic conditions of wartime China as actively obstructing the highly technical project of penicillin production, researchers at the NEPB relied crucially upon that same local environment to identify useful molds and find substitutions for key materials in successfully manufacturing penicillin in Kunming, capital of Yunnan Province in southwest China."
The prospects of human rights in US–China relations: a constructivist understanding.,"Kim, Hun Joon",International Relations of the Asia-Pacific,Oxford University Press / USA,HUMAN rights; BALANCE of power; CHINA; UNITED States; SOCIAL norms; INTERPERSONAL relations; CHINA studies; COMPREHENSION,,"What are the prospects of U.S.-China relations in the area of human rights? Skeptics maintain that human rights is no longer an issue between the United States and China. A traditional understanding of U.S.–China relations ignores the role of norms, while the constructivist perspective recognizes their independent effects. This paper links the traditional understanding of power politics between the United States and China with the study of constructivist norm research. The three findings of constructivist norm theories are relevant and applied to predict the status of human rights in U.S.-China relations: the historical construction of norms, the long-term and multifaceted effects of norms, and the persistence of norms. Based on these theoretical predictions, it is expected that, although convergence is not completely impossible, the past dynamic of competition and confrontation will continue and human rights will still be a contentious issue in U.S.-China relations."
The quest for recognition: Taiwan's military and trade agreements with Singapore under the one-China policy.,"Hsieh, Pasha L",International Relations of the Asia-Pacific,Oxford University Press / USA,"COMMERCIAL treaties; DEFENSE contracts; INTERNATIONAL relations; TAIWAN; LEE, Kuan Yew, 1923-2015",,"This article examines the evolution of Taiwan's relationship with Singapore since the 1960s as a unique case study in the Asia-Pacific. The theoretical concept of recognition in international relations (IR) and its nexus with international law are used to analyze the conclusion of the bilateral military and trade agreements absent diplomatic relations. The article argues that beyond security dimensions, the two states' struggles for recognition exhibit the formation of national identities, which invigorate the claims for sovereign state status in global politics. First, this article explores the emerging notion of recognition in IR and sheds light on the significance of Taiwan's presidential visit to Singapore under its one-China policy. Second, it explains Singapore's pursuit of external sovereignty that led to substantive defense cooperation with Taiwan, as well as the role of Lee Kuan Yew in facilitating Beijing–Taipei negotiations. Finally, it assesses contemporary developments such as the inking of the Taiwan–Singapore free trade agreement and the first-ever summit between the presidents of China and Taiwan in Singapore. Hence, the political and legal analysis of Singapore–Taiwan relations enriches the study of IR and contributes to the understanding of the foreign policy of China and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations."

This article shows how diverging views on future arrangements are leading to strategic shifts and increasing tension between these two Great Powers. As part of its quest for Great-Power status, China has been actively pushing its regional initiatives such as the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), as well as adopting assertive security policies towards its neighbours. In contrast, in order to counter China's growing influence America's regional strategy is undergoing a subtle shift from 'rebalancing to Asia' to focusing on the 'Indo-Pacific' region. However, amid an intensifying trade war and other challenges facing the region, China has chosen to moderate its proactive foreign policy-orientation in the past few years. In particular, China has made attempts to downplay its domestic rhetoric, rebuild strategic relationship with India and Japan, and to reassure ASEAN states in the South China Sea. In response to the Indo-Pacific strategy, it would be more effective for China to articulate a more inclusive regional vision and promote an institutional framework that also accommodates a US presence in the region."

The election of Donald Trump in 2016, significantly redefined American trade policy toward China. Despite the first months of his presidency, which promised an efficient, long-term cooperation between Beijing and Washington, incumbent president decided to implement severe restriction on the trade with China at the beginning of 2018. However, the announced imposition of tariffs on almost all goods coming from this country could interfere with the growth of the single states and the economy of the whole country in the future. Therefore the text is aimed to investigate the dependency of selected states on the inflows of Chinese investments since 2010. Finally, it is necessary to examine the phenomenon of the trade war, which has begun in July 2018, and assess its impact on the growth of both countries."
The Redistribution of Representation through Participation: Participatory Budgeting in Chengdu and Delhi.,"Frenkiel, Emilie; Lama-Rewal, Stéphanie Tawa",Politics & Governance,Cogitatio Press,BUDGET; PARTICIPATION; CIVIL society; CHENGDU (China),China; democracy; India; participation; participatory budgeting; representation,"A strong contention of the ""representative turn"" is that representation is consubstantial with politics (Saward, 2010). One way to test the heuristic value of this vision is to look for representation in an institution that was historically built against representation, namely participatory budgeting (PB), a democratic innovation that has spread globally with exceptional rapidity. The literature on PB identifies two types of relationships between participation and representation: (i) participation ""challenges"" (Houtzager & Gurza Lavalle, 2009) existing forms and principles of representation (through ""assumed representation"" by civil society activists; or through ""citizen agents""; Montambeault, 2016); or (ii) participation is ""instrumentalised"" (Fischer, 2012) by classic forms and actors of representation. On the basis of a comparative analysis of PB experiences in Chengdu (China) and Delhi (India), we argue in this article that a third type of relationship can be observed: participation-as implemented through PB-can also redistribute representation insofar as new, official representative roles are created. Moreover, looking at these new roles provides important clues about the principles of representation that are implemented and therefore about the transformative nature of PB."
The regional consequences of authoritarian power-sharing: Politburo representation and fiscal redistribution in China.,"Sheng, Yumin",Japanese Journal of Political Science,Cambridge University Press,POWER sharing governments; ECONOMICS; REPRESENTATIVE government; DICTATORSHIP; CHINESE Communist Party; CHINA,Authoritarian power-sharing; China; redistribution; representation; resource extraction; subnational regions,"Much political economy research examines how higher-level political representation of the constituent jurisdictions affects resource redistribution among the lower-level units in democracies, but little work has probed the redistributive consequences of regional political representation under dictatorship. This study investigates the effect of membership for provincial officials in the Politburo of the single-ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP) on fiscal resource flows between the central government and provincial governments in reform-era China. I find robust evidence that the provinces overseen by CCP Politburo members tended to remit more budgetary revenues to the center but did not receive larger central budgetary subsidies. This is consistent with a territorial logic of authoritarian power-sharing in single-party states, which suggests that the regionally selective presence at a collective ruling-party decision-making forum for subnational officials aims at tighter political control to help induce greater policy compliance from below."

Espoused by prominent Chinese international relations scholar Qin Yaqing, relational scholarship--I argue--is inclined to view individuals more dimly and the need for institutional arrangements that will safeguard group (and societal) solidarity. Hence relationality scholarship finds a sympathetic audience among Chinese intellectuals who place an emphasis on managing complex relationships in a community as a result of China's diversity. This article will map some of the key ideas of relational scholarship and highlight its strengths and weaknesses as a theoretical framework to understanding international relations."

At the 2017 Shangri-la Dialogue, there were only five mentions of the 'Indo-Pacific' at the annual defence ministerial forum. In the following year, the figure had jumped to 92. The Indo-Pacific Four countries promoting the 'free and open Indo-Pacific' (FOIP) concept share many principles, including freedom of navigation and overflight, connectivity and economic growth, and respect for the rule of law. There are, however, clear points of divergence between them, such that there are actually different Indo-Pacific strategies among the Indo-Pacific Four. Even if the Indo-Pacific Four manage to resolve these issues (and the possibility of this is low), it is not likely that ASEAN would endorse the FOIP concept. The reality remains that Indonesia and ASEAN have taken a different approach to the Indo-Pacific. The ASEAN approach is to appropriate elements of FOIP strategy which are more attractive to ASEAN (for example, connectivity and infrastructure), yet reject elements of FOIP strategy which ASEAN deems inappropriate (the exclusion of China and the loss of ASEAN centrality). This does not augur well for the adoption, in its entirety, of the FOIP concept by ASEAN."

In this issue of Russian Politics , we analyze three different aspects of this return of the siloviki : the way they think and see the world, how the relationship between governors and siloviki affects economic development at the regional level, and how the strengthening of the siloviki since 2012 compares to the strengthening of the Chinese internal security services, which took place during the same time. We identify a new assertiveness of Russia's siloviki, as well as a centralization of power around Vladimir Putin through the dismissal of other influential heavyweights within Russia's security services, and speculate what this might mean for Russia's short- to mid-term future."

Nor has China been a focus of the emerging literature on comparative financial nationalism. This is surprising as financial matters were central to modern Chinese nationalism when it began to take shape in the nineteenth and the twentieth centuries, and financial nationalism remains influential in contemporary China, which has undoubtedly become a major actor in the international financial system today. Our exploration of Chinese financial nationalism seeks to begin to fill this gap in both sets of literature. This article examines three areas of concern shared by Chinese financial nationalists past and present: currency, foreign financial institutions in China, and international borrowing/lending. We find that, as China's position in the international power hierarchy has evolved, the nature of financial nationalism has changed, from a largely inward and defensive orientation to an increasingly outward orientation. Our study also reveals diverse strands of thinking among Chinese financial nationalists, both now and in the earlier historical era, according to whether they hold a zero-sum or positive-sum conception of international financial relations. The case of China shows the richness of financial nationalism and highlights the importance of a nuanced understanding of this phenomenon."

The 21st century shows the possibility of the shift of power to the East. One of the key drivers of this process is China. It promotes the dictum of peaceful rise and attitude that favors globalization. Policies such as economic modernization through higher interaction with the world is one aspect. Its GDP has surpassed that of the US. The trade deficit of US with China is tragic. At the military level, spending has gone up. Along with this, China uses diplomacy for its advancement. The new projects like OBOR must be seen in this context. China is increasing its presence in Africa, especially with regard to its energy needs. In controversial issues such as the Korean issue, China's voice is considered as important by other nations. Now China has moved to another field called soft power projection. These will have adverse impact on the position of the US and over the world in areas such as environment, energy security and economic structure. This paper analyzes the concept of power transition in the context of rise of China as a global power."

Drawing on balance of power theory, I instead argue that the threat of Chinese predation is overstated. Rising in a crowded geopolitical neighbourhood, China faces incentives to avoid preying on the United States, and may even have reason to cooperate with the United States over the long term."

Within the orbit of Marxism, a group often called the ""new left"" mainly concentrated on economic liberalism and inequalities of wealth. Some of them also showed an affinity with the views of intellectuals referred to as statists. The statists' three main ideas can be summarized as the superiority of political sovereignty over the rule of law, a critique of the ""judicialization"" of politics and the need to ""repoliticize"" the state, and a critique of universalism and an assertion of Chinese exceptionalism. Some of the legal scholars who developed these ideas are directly influenced by Carl Schmitt (1888–1985), an authoritarian German legal scholar and political theorist. Important texts by the current Chinese group of statist thinkers provide an intellectual background to the recent evolution in Party ideology."

Among other efforts, Russia and China decided to empower the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) in order to attain regional security, establish a new energy club and reduce US influence in the region. Although the SCO lacks the material and political capacity to confront US interests directly, this organization has become an important tool to balance the US through the soft balancing policies of Russia and China. This article evaluates the posssibility of Sino-Russian collaboration through the SCO in terms of balancing the dominance of the US."
The Rise of Public–Private Partnerships in China: An Effective Financing Approach for Infrastructure Investment?,"Tan, Jie; Zhao, Jerry Zhirong",Public Administration Review,Wiley-Blackwell,PUBLIC-private sector cooperation; INFRASTRUCTURE financing; DEBATES & debating; STRATEGIC planning; PUBLIC debts; PUBLIC investments; FISCAL year,,"The rise of public‐private partnerships (PPPs) in China has spurred heated debates about their purpose and effectiveness. This article traces the fluctuation of China's PPPs over several decades and finds that PPPs have played a supplementary role in China's infrastructure investment, as a response to the pressures of fiscal shortfalls and government debts. The resurgence of PPPs in recent years aims to bridge the infrastructure gap and alleviate ballooning local debts. These expectations, however, are hard to realize. China's PPPs mainly involve state‐owned enterprises and place increasing financial burdens on the government. The central government has taken measures to attract private sector investment to mitigate the financial risk, but the prospects for PPPs remain unclear."
THE RISE OF THE PRINCELINGS IN CHINA: CAREER ADVANTAGES AND COLLECTIVE ELITE REPRODUCTION.,"Zhang, Tony Huiquan",Journal of East Asian Studies,Cambridge University Press,COMMUNISM; POSTCOMMUNISM; REGRESSION analysis; GROUP identity; CHINA,China; Communism and post-Communism; elite reproduction; princelings,"How have China's princelings benefitted from their family backgrounds in their careers? This study seeks to answer the question and, in so doing, to add to the existing factionalist and meritocracy approaches to Chinese political elites. Based on biographical data of 293 princelings, quantitative analyses show that princelings have various advantages over non-princeling officials on the Central Committee. This is not simply familial advantage, however, as regression analysis finds parents' rank and longevity do not significantly affect princelings' career outcomes. Rather, the findings suggest that princelings benefit from membership in an affiliative status group, which differs from factions. The qualitative analysis find princelings' status is formed and reproduced in a ""collective"" manner: (1) princelings' status and early advantages originated in the state's centralized resource allocation system; (2) princelings' education and career choices are intertwined with the state's practical and ideological goals; (3) princelings' shared life courses strengthens their collective identity; (4) princelings' career advantages are secured by the party-state's cadre management system. These factors combine to reproduce princelings' elite status within the party and state, what I term ""collective elite reproduction."""
The Road to Cynicism: The Political Consequences of Online Satire Exposure in China.,"Shao, Li; Liu, Dongshu",Political Studies,Sage Publications Inc.,"POLITICAL satire; INTERNET & politics; CHINESE satire; TWENTY-first century; CHINA -- Politics & government; SOCIAL conditions in China, 2000-",authoritarianism; China; experiment; online activism; political effect; political satire,"This article examines two competing theories explaining the effects of political satire on citizens in an authoritarian context. The ""activism"" proposition argues that political satire works as a form of resistance to erode people's support for the regime and encourages collective action. The ""cynicism"" proposition argues that while satire discourages regime support, it also discourages political participation. Our online survey experiment on young Chinese Internet users provides evidence supporting the cynicism proposition. Satire consumption reduces audiences' political trust, deflates their political efficacy, and discourages them from participating in politics, as it reduces the perceived severity of political problems and implies that audience participation is useless. We conclude that the dissemination of political satire may stabilize the authoritarian regime temporarily but induces it to become erosive in the long run."
'The rock that can't be moved': China's revised geostrategies in Myanmar.,"Lanteigne, Marc",Pacific Review,Taylor & Francis Ltd,INTERNATIONAL relations; DEMOCRATIZATION; PEACEBUILDING; ECONOMIC policy; BURMA; CHINA -- Foreign relations,belt and road; bounded rationality; China; geostrategy; Myanmar; resilience networks,"Since 2011, Myanmar has undertaken a series of domestic and foreign policy reforms, including democratisation and peacebuilding, before and after the watershed November 2015 elections in the country. These reform processes have called into question whether China, which has been Myanmar's dominant great power neighbour throughout the previous era of military government in the country formerly known as Burma, would find its strategic position eroding as Myanmar further opens to the international community. However, the concept of China 'losing' diplomatic ground to other actors, including the West, in Myanmar implies a zero-sum game that does not adequately address Beijing's still-formidable geostrategic presence vis-à-vis its southern neighbour. China has now started to implement a more multi-faceted, 'resilience network'-building approach to maintaining its special status in Myanmar's foreign policy, a situation which will persist as Myanmar continues its uncertain path towards further reform."
The Role of Indian Diaspora: A Look at India-Myanmar Relations.,"Janesar, Mohammad; Sahu, Rajesh",IUP Journal of International Relations,IUP Publications,EAST Indian diaspora; ETHNIC relations; NATIONAL security; INTERNATIONAL relations; INDIA -- Foreign relations; INDIA; BURMA -- Foreign relations,,"Indo-Myanmar relations are based on history and civilizational ties. Indo-Myanmar's close socio-economic, commercial, political, cultural relations had existed all through the ages dating back to ancient and medieval times. Beyond these ties, ethnic links between the people of Myanmar and India exist in four states bordering Myanmar, namely, Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur, Nagaland, and Mizoram, and have continued since antiquity. In contemporary epoch, both countries have been enjoying warm and friendly relations. For example, Myanmar is the only gateway to Southeast Asia connecting India by land and acts as a buffer zone between the northeastern region and China. Myanmar is considered as one of India's immediate neighbors and part of its successful Look East Policy (LEP), currently Act East Policy (AEP). For India, Myanmar is the connecting bridge as it is crucial for India's LEP, besides the development of stronger ties with Southeast Asia and East Asian countries. Consequently, it is important to examine the role of the Indian Diaspora in achieving internal (stabilizing border areas) as well as external (stabilizing Southeast Asia) security objectives of India. The diaspora has emerged as a powerful lobby since they are documented as ""soft power"" in International Relations and foreign policy strategy. It is also a driving force or agent of economic development between India and Myanmar. Therefore, this paper attempts to study the role of the Indian Diaspora in transforming the bilateral relations between India and Myanmar in the contemporary context."
The Role of London and Frankfurt in Supporting the Internationalisation of the Chinese Renminbi.,"Pacheco Pardo, Ramon; Knoerich, Jan; Li, Yuanfang",New Political Economy,Taylor & Francis Ltd,MONEY; NATIONAL currencies; CHINA; RENMINBI,China; currency internationalisation; negotiated currency; renminbi,"Why do foreign countries support the internationalisation of the renminbi (RMB) by establishing offshore RMB centres? The Chinese government has openly stated that internationalisation of the country's currency is one of its top priorities. International use of the RMB has already significantly increased in recent years. Yet, existing literature has almost exclusively focused on the structure of the Chinese economy and China's domestic politics to explain RMB internationalisation. With this article, we seek to fill a gap in the literature by analysing the reasons why foreign countries support RMB internationalisation. Using the cases of Germany and the UK, we show that a combination of economic and political factors, partly in response to inducements from Beijing, best explain why foreign countries support Chinese efforts to internationalise the RMB. Some of these factors are similar to both countries, but there are also differences regarding the reasons why they support this key Chinese goal. We use the case of the establishment of offshore RMB centres to conduct our analysis, given the clear political nature of foreign countries allowing China to open them in their own territory. We thus also show that the Chinese currency is starting to display the characteristics of negotiated currencies."

Considered as middle powers, both countries are members of two associations of maritime democracies, namely: the Democratic Security Diamond (DSD), and the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (QUAD). Since the formation of their special strategic partnership, Japan and Australia have jointly assisted in building up the capabilities of the Philippine Navy (PN), Philippine Coast Guard (PCG), and the Philippine Air Force (PAF). The recent dramatic shift in Philippine foreign policy direction fosters this triangular security relationship. On the one hand, President Rodrigo Duterte, in distancing the Philippines from the United States (the country's traditional ally) favors closer security ties with Japan and Australia. On the other hand, Japan and Australia want to prevent the Philippines from gravitating closer to China's orbit of influence and power. Gradually, however, this development can either modify or erode the American hub-and-spoke system of alliance in East Asia and increase the spoke-to-spoke links leading to the creation of minilateral and plurilateral security arrangements in the Indo-Pacific region."
The Role of the Non-state Film Industry in Promoting China's Soft Power.,"Yang, Yanling",Hague Journal of Diplomacy,Brill Academic Publishers,IDEOLOGY; CULTURAL diplomacy; CHINA; MOTION picture industry; CHINESE films; DOMESTIC fiction; MOTION picture actors & actresses; SEMI-structured interviews,China; cultural diplomacy; international communication; international film industry; non-state actors; propaganda; public diplomacy; soft power,"Summary: This article explores the role of non-state actors from the film industry in promoting China's soft power. Much research on non-state actors has emphasised the Anglophone world, while little research has been undertaken in the context of non-democratic regimes such as China. Therefore, following scholarly reviews on soft power and the role of its key actors, this article analyses China's approach to soft power, based on semi-structured interviews conducted with film experts to explore the role of non-state actors in generating soft power. The study reveals that although China has consistently privileged state-owned actors over non-state actors, non-state actors have actually played an increasingly important role in disseminating soft power. The article argues that the more powerfully the Chinese authorities emphasise China's state actors, the less likely it is that China will win hearts and minds — because of China's domestic political ideology and censorship mechanism in the field."
The rule of law and maritime security: understanding lawfare in the South China Sea.,"Guilfoyle, Douglas",International Affairs,Oxford University Press / USA,TERRITORIAL waters; INTERNATIONAL law; MARITIME law; INTERNATIONAL security; BOUNDARY disputes; SOUTH China Sea; MARITIME boundaries; CHINA -- Politics & government -- 2002-,China; international law; maritime security,"Does the rule of law matter to maritime security? One way into the question is to examine whether states show a discursive commitment that maritime security practices must comply with international law. International law thus provides tools for argument for or against the validity of certain practices. The proposition is thus not only that international law matters to maritime security, but legal argument does too. In this article, these claims will be explored in relation to the South China Sea dispute. The dispute involves Chinese claims to enjoy special rights within the 'nine-dash line' on official maps which appears to lay claim to much of the South China Sea. Within this area sovereignty remains disputed over numerous islands and other maritime features. Many of the claimant states have engaged in island-building activities, although none on the scale of China. Ideas matter in such contests, affecting perceptions of reality and of what is possible. International law provides one such set of ideas. Law may be a useful tool in consolidating gains or defeating a rival's claims. For China, law is a key domain in which it is seeking to consolidate control over the South China Sea. The article places the relevant Chinese legal arguments in the context of China's historic engagement with the law of the sea. It argues that the flaw in China's approach has been to underestimate the extent to which it impinges on other states' national interests in the maritime domain, interests they conceptualize in legal terms."
The Security Dilemma and India-China Relations.,"Raghavan, Srinath",Asian Security,Taylor & Francis Ltd,DILEMMA; NATIONAL security; CHINA-India relations,,"This article examines whether the concept of a security dilemma is useful in understanding the trajectory of India-China relations over the past seven decades. It considers several phases through which this relationship has passed and it argues that the security dilemma has never been at work. The relationship is characterized not by a security dilemma but by fundamental conflicts of interests. These have been exacerbated or ameliorated by changes in domestic politics and the wider strategic context. Going forward, too, these factors are likely to influence relationship."

Some reasons of Chinese offensive have been intertwined with each other, though the first reason is the main issue and the origin of the Senkaku Islands Dispute. It seems that other three reasons are supportive reasons for the natural resources demand, and byproducts of the dispute between Japan and China. The author discusses the occurrence and changes of these four reasons and concludes that the third and fourth reasons will be more troublesome than the others because they are unpredictable."

The choice between alignment and hedging for small states generally represents a trade-off between survival and autonomy and is mostly predicated on the action of relevant great powers. The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is particularly important in this case, as it could be the key factor deciding Vietnam's overall posture toward China over the long term. While China's expansionist behavior in the South China Sea has pushed Vietnam toward alignment with the USA, the BRI, if implemented successfully, could convince Vietnam that maintaining the default hedging position is the best option."

This paper argues that China has been ""socialized"" by its international security environment by exploring Kenneth Waltz's theoretical mechanism of the ""socialization"" of states in the international system. The 1995–1996 Taiwan Strait Crisis and the early 2000s, the Senkaku/Diaoyutai crises from 2012 to 2015, and the South China Sea in the mid-1990s are all instances in which China has employed force only to suffer strategically. This has eventually led to a less confrontational posture and contributed to the pursuit of a more cooperative engagement strategy with both Southeast Asia (from 1998 to 2008) and Taiwan (∼ 2006–2016). Variations in China's assertiveness can be explained by the combination of domestic politics and signals from China's international security environment."

"The South Korea–US Alliance under the North Korean Nuclear Threat: A Reluctant Return to the ""Autonomy–Security Trade‐Off"".","Park, Hwee‐rhak",Pacific Focus,Wiley-Blackwell,HYDROGEN bomb; NUCLEAR weapons; THREATS; SOUTH Korea; NORTH Korea,,"This paper aims to examine the US–South Korea alliance from the perspective of the ""Autonomy–Security Trade‐off"" (AST) model, which was introduced by Michael F. Altfeld in the 1980s. This model could be a useful tool to ascertain the minimum conditions for the implementation of the US nuclear umbrella, which is a life‐and‐death issue for South Korea (ROK) given the serious North Korean nuclear threat. For this purpose, this paper introduces the key concept of the model and applies it to the ROK‐US alliance, analyzing the controversy over the deployment of the US Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system (THAAD) to South Korea as a case study. The analysis found that South Korea started its alliance with the United States based on the AST model. However, South Korea became reluctant in yielding its autonomy to the United States in the 1990s, and initiated ""balanced diplomacy"" between the United States and China and the reclaiming of the Operational Control Authority (OPCON) from the commander of the ROK‐US Combined Forces Command (CFC), a US General, in the 2000s. It delayed the deployment of the US THAAD for 3 years only because China opposed the deployment even after North Korea had succeeded to develop its nuclear weapons. However, South Korea had to return to the original AST model, albeit reluctantly, because of the emergence of a more serious North Korean nuclear threat, including hydrogen bombs. It did not try, with any great effort, to improve its relationship with China, and reduced the scope of OPCON by appointing a South Korean General as the Command of the CFC, allowing the deployment of the THAAD. Now that North Korea has the potential capabilities to strike the US mainland, South Korea cannot afford to be reluctant in yielding its autonomy to the United States. In this context, South Korea should not pursue its balanced diplomacy between the United States and China any longer. To the contrary, it should participate in the United States' Indo‐Pacific strategy. It may also need to stop its pursuit of appointing its general as the Commander of the CFC until North Korea gives up its nuclear weapons. It should also become more willing to increase its cost‐sharing with the United States. In conclusion, South Korea should try to accept the recommendations from the AST model as long as its needs the US nuclear umbrella and wants to protect its people from the North Korean nuclear threat."
The stability of proximity: the resilience of Sino-Japanese relations over the Senkaku/Diaoyu Dispute.,"Yu, Yun; Kim, Ji Young",International Relations of the Asia-Pacific,Oxford University Press / USA,INTERNATIONAL security; CRISIS management; INTERNATIONAL relations; SENKAKU Islands; CHINA-Japan relations,,"The Senkaku/Diaoyu dispute, a territorial dispute between Japan and China, has long been regarded as a ticking bomb, capable of blowing up the already volatile Sino-Japanese relations at any time. Would the differences over the islands lead China and Japan into major military confrontations, if not all-out war? This article argues that there is cause for optimism and that the Sino-Japanese relationship has displayed a remarkable level of resiliency through the years. In examining the three major diplomatic crises of 2004, 2010, and 2012 (and beyond) surrounding the Senkaku/Diaoyu dispute, this article shows that Japan and China have successfully engaged in bilateral crisis management by operating political, diplomatic, and military exchanges to prevent further escalation. Our analysis calls for a more informed and balanced view within academic discourse, so as to encourage accurate threat perceptions between China and Japan, mitigate the security dilemma, thereby eventually fulfilling the optimistic theory."

This relationship has evolved with the dynamics of capital-labor conflicts and contradictions within a regime of accumulation and transitioned from a stage of ""great compromise"" to a stage of ""strained alliance."""

The development of Chinese political science is characterised by institutionalisation, professionalisation, and internationalisation on the one hand, and tensions between Westernisation and indigenisation, scientification and methodological pluralism, and the ""ivory tower"" and political relevance, on the other. The debate centres on contending beliefs on the nature of political knowledge and ways to convert understanding of Chinese politics into knowledge and shows a serious tension and conflict between scientific, universalistic, and positivist traditions on the one hand and particularistic, historical, and contextual traditions on the other hand. We argue that a ""glocalisation"" approach might be adopted to integrate ""globalisation"" and ""localisation"" of Chinese political studies by exploring the reciprocal influences of the two aspects, being methodologically both ""scientific"" and ""pluralistic"", and balancing between scholarship and public relevance. We hope to help Western academics learn about achievements and struggles in the study of political science in China, and also to push Chinese political science to engage more with the rest of the world."

Even though China's military strategic guideline always stays on the track of ""active defense,"" the essence has been shifting from tradition to informationization. Since satellites are able to provide space information support so as to fulfill informationization, once informationization becomes the focus of military strategy, it is supposed to bring momentum to the research and development of satellites. Therefore, satellite development can be considered as an index to check whether the military strategy is being implemented or not. China is continuously making progress in satellite development. Especially since the informationization was included in the guideline in the Hu Jintao era, satellites started to be able to conduct space information support missions. In conclusion, China is sincerely fulfilling its military strategy through consistent satellite development. On the other hand, ""local war"" is another focus of strategic guidelines, it implies that China considers its national interests mainly concentrated on this region so far. However, while China's interests are expanding globally, China will need to cultivate its global dominance based on rapid satellite development to safeguard the global interest; ""Winning the informationized war globally"" might be the next focus."
"THE TEST OF INVENTIVENESS IN CHINESE PATENT JURISPRUDENCE: RECENT HISTORY, CASES, AND ANALYSIS.","Yue Wang, Ada","Journal of Law, Technology & Policy",Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois,PATENT law; ECONOMIC history; LEGAL history; JURISPRUDENCE; WORLD politics; CHINA,,"Juristic effort to discern inventiveness or non-obviousness occupies the center of patent law's theoretical gravity. What kind of invention deserves a governmental grant of economic exclusivity often hinges on the purpose of the patent law as defined by the lawmakers. China enacted its first Patent Law in the 1980s and has experienced several doctrinal changes. How the inventiveness standard in the Chinese patent law developed poses at once a question of political history and legal theory. Current scholarship abounds in illumination of the historical and socio-economic factors driving the development of the inventiveness standard in Chinese patent jurisprudence. While this paper also sheds light on the political and economic history of the Chinese patent law legislation, it will try to stand apart from the current literature by means of its focus on the jurisprudential development behind the doctrinal changes in the Chinese inventiveness standard. During the investigation of this issue, the paper identifies the two doctrinal systems from whom the Chinese patent jurists purported to borrow their ideas: the EU problem-solution approach and the U.S. non-obviousness approach. This paper makes the case that in recent years Chinese patent jurists have made the momentous choice for the EU approach. This choice must further be evaluated by mapping the profound philosophical differences between the two contrasting approaches. Ultimately, this paper argues that the choice reflects the Chinese patent jurists' confidence in the greater capacity for objectivity, juridical consistency and uniformity of the problem-solution approach to the inventiveness determination."

But are we destined to hear echoes of ""Carthago delenda est"" [Carthage must be destroyed] from Beijing and Washington across the Pacific? With the tension notably on the rise in the issue-specific domains of the Taiwan Strait, South China Sea, and the Korean Peninsula, there is cause to delve deeper into the contemporary 'Thucydides Trap', as expounded by Graham Allison. This paper will focus on the latest developments of the ongoing Korean Peninsula Nuclear Crisis, post Six-Party Talks, as an issue-specific domain to evaluate the changing power dynamic between an established and a rising power. Here the Thucydides Trap and the challenges presented by policy makers in both China and the USA make special reference to the danger of being plunged into a hegemonic conflict. This analysis covers two trajectories: 1) following the conservative approach - balance of power and conditions of hegemony; and 2) concerning a balance of hierarchies - in which the two hierarchies run parallel to each other. Due to China's rising power in both military and economic fields, it simultaneously presages the relative decline of American power projection. Allison also reconfirms that an established power, in this case the USA, is challenged by a rising power, personified by China, concludes that the likelihood of war has substantially increased. Despite the fact of their growing geopolitical rivalry, both acknowledge the calculus of falling into the trap and realize that a major conflict would devastate their geopolitical positions. Put more directly, finding the great escape from this trap remains the central issue in the contemporary world, raising the conceptionally challenging question as to whether Allison's theoretical construction is heuristically sound."

WeChat enables strong-tie communicative networks, which prior research indicates is consequential for contentious political engagement. Drawing on evidence from focus groups conducted with Chinese citizens in the United Kingdom, we reveal that although WeChat users are often connected through offline social and professional networks, contentious politics manifests on the app only under a narrow range of circumstances. Furthermore, political contention on WeChat is reported by our respondents to be largely confined to matters of 'interest-oriented' and/or 'safe' topics that do not challenge the wider political system. This trend is driven by a combination of political and cultural dynamics which we elaborate in a theoretically informed thematic analysis, arguing that engaging with the concept of guanxi provides more insight into the political repercussions of WeChat in China than a focus on tie strength."

The U.S. One‐China policy is creative and elastic, which could be constricted or stretched, depending on the changing strategic circumstances and the needs of American national security. The United States has an interest to enlarge the scope and depth of cooperation with Taipei in the Indo‐Pacific region to cope with a more powerful and assertive PRC."
The U.S. Military Presence in the Persian Gulf and Its Impact on Energy Security of East Asian Countries (2000-2017).,"Koushki, Mohammad Sadeq; Moslehi, Shahrokh",Journal of International & Area Studies,Seoul National University,ENERGY security; NATIONAL security; INTERNATIONAL competition; PERSIAN Gulf; EAST Asians; BAYS,America; China; India; Japan; Oil; South Korea; the Persian Gulf,"Maintaining the security of free flow of energy from the Persian Gulf is one of the reasons that America gives for its military presence in this region. The region's trade volume with America, and its allies such as Europe, Japan, and South Korea is high. But the United States is reluctant to allow its allies to expand their respective ties with the region that would reach a similar level with the U.S. position. This is because America's dominance over the Persian Gulf's hydrocarbon resources is among its priorities. Obviously through this dominant status, the U.S. can maintain its dominance over the global economy. Moreover stability of the oil prices is also important to the United States because any rise in oil prices can affect the economy of American allies and consequently spread through the whole industrial world. As it has been stipulated in 2015 American National Security Strategy, undoubtedly ensuring security for free flow of energy from the Persian Gulf to the world will remain among U.S. reasons for its military presence in this region. Given the build up of its military power in the Persian Gulf, its future military presence in this region to dominate the rivals is inevitable. Therefore, despite the Pivot to Asia strategy and the continued importance of Asia-Pacific region, U.S. will remain interested in the Persian Gulf region. We find that this strategy is not in contrast with the result of our study. Here the research question is the impact of American military presence in the Persian Gulf region on the energy security of East Asian countries during the period of our study. American officials claim that the maintaining security of free flow of energy, supporting allies, combating terrorism as well as WMD are among their reasons for their presence in the region, but the main hypothesis of this study is that America is determined to be in control of the region's hydrocarbon resources and keeping international rivals and allies away from them. This research tests this hypothesis."
The UK's Strategic Partnership with China beyond Brexit: Economic Opportunities Facing Political Constraints.,"Irwin Crookes, Paul; Farnell, John",Journal of Current Chinese Affairs,Sage Publications Inc.,"ECONOMIC systems; FREE trade; INTERNATIONAL economic relations; CHINA; GREAT Britain; EUROPEAN Union; BRITISH withdrawal from the European Union, 2016-; ECONOMIC opportunities; VOTES (People); MODALITY (Logic); ASIANS",Brexit; China; EU; investment; political constraints; trade; United Kingdom,"This analysis examines the opportunities and challenges facing the United Kingdom (UK) government in building a closer economic partnership with China beyond Brexit. While showing how the goals of each side overlap in key areas of mutual interest, evidence is presented to explain how fundamental imbalances persist in trade and investment relations due to China's economic management system. The authors further argue that political constraints imposed on the UK by the European Union (EU) and the United States (US) as economic partners will constrain the British government's room for manoeuvre when negotiating with the Chinese. The analysis identifies potential modalities for achieving some improvement in UK-China bilateral links by drawing on the outcome of the Switzerland-China Free Trade Agreement but concludes that political factors will continue to limit outcomes and that a major transformation of UK-China economic relations is not a realistic prospect for the foreseeable future."

While none of these countries voted against the adoption of the GCM, there are significant differences in how individual countries approached the commitments made in the GCM. These perspectives were articulated in a webinar hosted by Metropolis Asia on 20 June 2018 and in governmental statements made at the UN international conference when the GCM was adopted. This article also discusses the challenges confronting the implementation of the GCM. While the Compact resulted from inclusive and intensive negotiations and many compromises, the road towards realizing its goals will be at least as challenging as the road that led to its adoption. In spite of these challenges, the GCM is a ground‐breaking representation of the first multilateral framework for migration governance. Its success rests upon the recognition that addressing the challenges and maximizing the benefits of migration require true international cooperation, renewed commitment and meaningful action on the commitments agreed to."
The Unintended Consequences of Politicization of the Belt and Road's China-Europe Freight Train Initiative.,"Tjia, Yin-nor Linda",China Journal,University of Chicago Press,BELT & Road Initiative; COST effectiveness; TRANSPORTATION; FEDERAL government; RAILROAD trains; CHINA,,"The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) has been widely criticized as a purely strategic project to enhance China's international influence. Focusing on an ongoing yet underresearched signature BRI project, the China-Europe freight train routes, this article challenges such a sweeping characterization, which has masked the complexities of the reality. The freight initiative arose from local-level actors in multiple sites as a cost-effective means to make use of preexisting rail tracks across Asia to enhance transport efficiency. Their efforts later metamorphosed into what today looks like a grand unified project, politicized by the national government and subsidized by competing provincial capitals. The article provides an explanation for the complex consequences of the freight train project's politicization."

The alliance security dilemma now manifests itself in the rise of 'entrapment' concerns for Washington and 'abandonment' anxieties for Tokyo. The US increasingly insists on more mutuality in alliance arrangements, while seeking to maintain ambiguity in its defence commitments to Japan. The relative decline of US power and the fluid regional security architecture, however, incentivise Japan to step up preparations for abandonment. Although Tokyo's hedging strategy contributes to enhancement of the bilateral alliance in the short term, it also paves the way for Japan's pursuit of strategic autonomy in the medium to long term."
The variable effectiveness of hedging strategies.,"Ciorciari, John D",International Relations of the Asia-Pacific,Oxford University Press / USA,INTERNATIONAL relations; INTERNATIONAL security; INTERNATIONAL Monetary Fund; INVESTMENTS; FINANCIAL risk,,"Governments often adopt hedging strategies to mitigate risks they face in international affairs. They hedge in the conventional, financial sense of the term by seeking to offset risks in global markets. They also adopt strategies to hedge against international security hazards by preserving strategic ambiguity, forging limited security alignments, and cultivating modest self-protection in case potential threats materialize. Both types of hedging typically are seen as prudent behavior. However, hedging strategies sometimes fail. Risks can be difficult to calculate, and the measures needed to hedge against them can be costly. Hedging international security risks can be particularly challenging, as governments sometimes lack access to adequate protective options at any price. This article illustrates the argument with two contrasting cases: relatively successful Southeast Asian hedging against the risk of financial calamity after the 1997 crisis and less effective efforts by some of the same states to hedge against the security risk of Chinese encroachment in the South China Sea."

Theorizing India–US–China strategic triangle.,"Paul, T.

We argue that triangles are important in influencing state behavior in the areas of balance of power, deterrence, arms races and status competition, and consider how these dimensions might interact. In this context, this article examines the US–India–China triangle, while also addressing to a lesser extent how other related triangles interlink with it, taking into account how China's rise and increasing economic interdependence impact these relations."

This is not just because of the country's sheer size and international economic influence, but also because the Chinese political economy can provide fertile ground to theorize on aspects of CC that are widely recognized to pose challenges. I employ the analytical framework of Sino-capitalism to demonstrate the importance of an open and evolutionary approach. Specifically, Sino-capitalism centres on state-centric modes of governance interacting dialectically with bottom-up networked modes of entrepreneurship exposed to market forces and global capital. The dialectic evolutionary quality of Sino-capitalism contrasts with the more static comparative approaches in most of the CC literature. China's emergent capitalism forces the observer to open up the black box of capitalist evolution and 'bring back in' classical approaches to studying political economy. Capitalist political economies are thus conceived of as encompassing different politico-economic spheres, each with its own logic. Leveraging the analytical framework of Sino-capitalism for the continued theoretical development of CC elucidates in this manner the architectonic role of the state, the chronic re-composition and rebalancing of the institutional spheres of state and capital, and the existence of contradictory cum symbiotic politico-economic logics that reproduce capitalism."
There and back again: What the Cold War for Southeast Asia can teach us about Sino-US competition in the region today.,"Ngoei, Wen-Qing",International Journal,Sage Publications Inc.,INTERNATIONAL relations; SOUTHEAST Asia; COMPETITION (Psychology),Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN); Chinese foreign policy; Cold War; Sino-US rivalry; South China Sea; Southeast Asia; United States foreign policy,"This essay examines how the history of the Cold War in Southeast Asia has shaped, and will likely continue to shape, the current Sino-US rivalry in the region. Expert commentary today typically focuses on the agendas and actions of the two big powers, the United States and China, which actually risks missing the bigger picture. During the Cold War, leaders of ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) played a critical role in containing Chinese influence, shaping the terms of Sino-US competition and rapprochement, and deepening the US presence in Southeast Asia. The legacy of ASEAN's foreign relations during and since the Cold War imposes constraints on Chinese regional ambitions today, which militates against the popular notion that Chinese hegemony in East and Southeast Asia is inevitable. This essay underscores that current analyses of the brewing crisis in and around the South China Sea must routinely look beyond the two superpowers to the under-appreciated agency of small- and middle-sized ASEAN actors who, in reality, are the ones who hold the fate of the region in their hands."

Even less examined is the role of party-to-party relations between the African National Congress (ANC) and the Communist Party of China (CPC) in the process of building relations between these two states, as well as that of the early contact between South Africa's National Party (NP) government and China. This research finds that the expectations of Pretoria and Beijing were largely incompatible in the early 1990s while no fundamental disagreement existed between South Africa and Taiwan at the time. The 'Mandela factor' and the general lack of knowledge about China in South Africa, furthermore, contributed to the prolonged process of building formal relations. In addition, the article also argues that the legacies of the early inter-party relations between the ANC and CPC, which played a role in South Africa's decision-making and opinion formation in the early 1990s, cannot be ignored, and helps to explain the delay in the establishment of diplomatic relations to 1998."

Think territory politically: the making and escalation of Beijing's commitment to Sovereignize Diaoyu/Senkaku Islands.,"Xiaolin, Duan",Pacific Review,Taylor & Francis Ltd,SOVEREIGNTY; NATIONALISM; PATRIOTISM; BEIJING (China); JAPAN; TAIWAN; HYDROCARBONS,Diaoyu/Senkaku Island dispute; Japan–China relations; nationalism; Territorial dispute,"In popular narratives, intellectual and media analysts believe the Diaoyu/Senkaku Islands dispute between China and Japan is a contestation for potential hydrocarbon reserves and other maritime rights which are per se divisible, but nationalism – particularly on China side – and relative power change between the two competing claimants make these territories increasingly indivisible and the dispute war-prone. Based on a review over People's Daily's coverage of the disputes and other secondary information, this article reveals a different scenario by highlighting the political meanings of disputed territories for national cohesion and regime self-preservation. It finds, Beijing's strategic moves in the disputes are influenced by its efforts at different occasions to de-legitimate Republic of China at Taiwan and defend its core interests – namely Taiwan and the ""One-China"" principle, to appease the patriotism in Hong Kong and facilitate the latter's stable reversion to China in 1990s, and what is more, to rally popular support at home. In addition, Beijing's Diaoyu/Senkaku strategy did not follow a carefully calculated path, but was mostly reactive to the contingencies and ultimately took shape through the incremental accumulation of previous policies and behaviours."

The massacre crystalized the mistrust between China and Hong Kong into an open ideological conflict—Leninist authoritarianism versus liberal democracy—that has colored relations between the two since then. This article tracks the hold that authoritarianism has gained over liberal values in Hong Kong in the past thirty years and reflects on what needs to be done in the next thirty years for the balance to be re-tilted and sustained beyond 2047, when China's fifty-year commitment to preserving Hong Kong's autonomy expires. Still surviving (just) as a largely liberal (though by no means fully democratic) jurisdiction after two decades of Chinese rule, Hong Kong is a testing ground for whether China can respect liberal values, how resilient such values are to the alternative authoritarian vision offered by an economic superpower, and the potential for establishing a liberal-democratic pocket within an authoritarian state. The territory's everyday wrestle with Chinese pressures speaks to the liberal struggles against authoritarian challenges (in their various guises) that continue to plague the world thirty years after the end of the Cold War.​"

The two states stand, in geopolitical terms, back‐to‐back to each other, as Russia gives priority attention to the confrontation on its Western theatre and China focuses of security matters in East Asia and trade relations with the United States. The China–Russia presidential pseudo‐alliance has experienced at least three major turns in its development since the middle of this decade. Presently, it has transformed into a one‐sided Russian dependency upon indifferent China and is certain to experience further challenges, as the two parties proceed along clearly diverging courses."

This paper aims to make good on this by maintaining reflexivity about tensions. Drawing on traditions of pragmatism, the paper identifies tyrannies besetting understandings of participatory governance. Tyrannies are ways of thinking that developed in response to an identified issue, but which fail to live up to their initial promise. Despite this, those particular ways of thinking continue to hold sway. The paper sets three key tyrannies: the quest for authenticity in non-elected representation; assumptions about leadership models; and 'bottom-up' versus 'top-down' debates. First, despite widespread acknowledgement of the value of lived experience in participatory governance, in the quest for authenticity, it is simultaneously reified yet denied. Second, we question assumed symbiotic alignments between participatory governance and ideas of distributed leadership. Third, we present a critique of the fetishisation of 'bottom-up' approaches in participatory governance. It concludes with the role of reflexivity in re-negotiating the politics of participatory governance."

Buddhists call this process Interbeing. I draw on Daoist yin/yang dynamics for epistemology and the ancient Silk Roads as an exemplar. Subsequently, I apply this analysis to a watershed development in our contemporary political economy: China's 'Belt and Road Initiative' (BRI). A $1 trillion investment scheme to link China with Europe and Russia through Central Asia, Africa, and the Indian Ocean, the BRI provokes charges of reproducing Europe's 19th-century's Great Game on a 21st-century scale. A trialectical epistemology offers another mode and model of global interaction for the BRI. It highlights the possibility of local agency and global responsibility for the BRI. I ask: Can epistemic compassion turn this 5.0 version of Asian Capitalism into a 2.0 version of the Silk Road Ethos? The potential exists, I argue."

While the Experiment Area's plans to construct terraces and ditches were not well suited to the socioeconomic and environmental conditions that existed in rural Gansu during the 1940s, its introduction of non-native tree and grass species to check water and soil loss met with an enthusiastic response from Tianshui's populace. Water and soil conservation specialists aspired to rationalize human interactions with the environment as part of wartime efforts to develop the northwest, but to realize these goals they had to take socioecological realities in the region and the needs of rural residents into account. Wartime conservation's environmental legacies, the article also shows, extended into the period after 1949."

In today’s globalized world, however, the vast majority of international economic interactions are conducted by firms, not states. The success of the BRI therefore depends on whether and how China can compel its firms to behave in a way that serves the strategic interests of the state. Using a unique firm-level survey, we find that Chinese firms’ interests in the BRI do not necessarily align with those of the state. Despite similar perceived risks and challenges to participation in the BRI among private and state-owned firms in China, state-owned enterprises are much more likely than private ones to express a willingness to participate in the BRI. These findings highlight the importance of state control in the exercise of economic statecraft."

Toward gender sensitivity: women and climate change policies in China.,"Zhou, Yuan; Sun, Xiaoyan",International Feminist Journal of Politics,Taylor & Francis Ltd,,China; climate change; environment; Gender; gender sensitivity,"Climate change and environmental protection have become increasingly important in China. The country has formulated and strictly enforced a series of policies to address climate change directly. This article argues for the importance of studying China's climate change policies from a gender perspective, particularly given the speed and import of action. It does so in three steps. First, it examines gendered differences in perceptions of climate change and in the impacts of climate change policies. Second, it examines the environment-related content in China's gender policies and the gender-related content in its climate change policies. Through the comparison between these two, we argue that it is easier to include climate change in gender policies in China than to include gender in climate change policies and that the integration of these two is anything but robust. Third, we analyze the multiple and varied roles played by women in climate change policy making, as well as women's conspicuous absence from some key high-level political conversations. The article concludes that gender awareness in Chinese climate change policy needs to be supplemented by gender sensitivity and we suggest some measures to move toward this goal."

China has been among the leading trade partners of the UK. Economic relations between the UK and China have skyrocketed over the past 10 years. China has also become the economic powerhouse that the rest of the world is turning to in the aftermath of the global economic crisis. While the UK is indifferent to the China's apathy for a united Europe, it certainly cannot ignore its trade with China at a risk associated with the challenge posted by the Brexit against the legal framework for the economic and trade relations between the UK and China. This paper argues for a free trade agreement between China and the UK (China–UK FTA) to make up for the pitfalls associated with the Brexit."

In response, toleration has become the common sense of people in modern society. However, what is the meaning of the word toleration? What moral emotions underlie the practice of toleration? This article puts forward a morally defensible concept of toleration inspired by ancient Chinese thinking. I first discuss the etymology of the word toleration from Anglophone and Chinese perspectives, and then analyse three problematical emotional attitudes towards others (disgust, indifference and hunting for novelty) and critique the spirit of exclusion in the dominant Anglophone understanding of toleration. Finally, I analyse a morally defensible concept of toleration based on the 'the dao of zhong and shu ' (忠恕之道) that also served as the ideal underpinning political unity and appreciation for cultural diversity in ancient China."
"Towards Contested 'Spheres of Influence' in the Western Pacific: Rising China, Classical Geopolitics, and Asia-Pacific Stability.","Schreer, Benjamin",Geopolitics,Taylor & Francis Ltd,"GEOPOLITICS; EAST Asia; CHINA-United States relations; SPYKMAN, Nicholas; MACKINDER, Halford John, Sir, 1861-1947",,"The evolution of US-Sino great power competition in East Asia has emerged as a key geostrategic issue in international politics. A central question is whether the 'geography of the peace' will prevail where, despite their natural predisposition to compete for regional hegemony, the two great powers respect each other's 'spheres of influence'. This concept assumes that, as a major continental power, China remains preoccupied with securing its land borders and expanding its influence on the Eurasian land mass. In contrast, this article argues that the Sino-US rivalry likely leads to the emergence of a 'geography of conflict' in East Asia because of overlapping zones of strategic interests. Applying a classical geopolitics approach, it shows that the geopolitical models of British geographer Sir Halford Mackinder, US naval strategist Alfred Thayer and Dutch-American geostrategist Nicholas Spykman are useful to explain the current behaviour of China and the United States, and why, as a result, East Asia is becoming more contested."

Mapping Chinese Discourse on the China–US Trade War.,"Wei, Li",Chinese Journal of International Politics,Oxford University Press / USA,"INTERNATIONAL trade disputes; ECONOMICS; INTERNATIONAL economic relations; CONFLICT theory; CHINA; TELECOMMUNICATION equipment & supplies; TRUMP, Donald, 1946-",,"Tremendous changes have occurred in China–US relations since Donald J. Trump took office in the White House, but the most significant event is the outbreak of the China–US trade war, whose unprecedented scale and impact has drawn wide attention in China and sparked considerable debate. This article aims to review the four main stages of this great debate on the China–US trade war among China's influential intellectuals and prominent thinkers. It covers the three-year period since beginning of the Trump administration. The initial argument among Chinese academics was whether or not there could ever be a trade war, which led to a dividing line between optimists and pessimists. Soon after, when China-US relations took a sharp downturn and a trade war seemed inevitable, Chinese scholars shifted their focus to reasons why the United States should wage a trade war against China. This culminated in three different perspectives embodied respectively in the structural conflict theory, institutional conflict theory, and the theory on exporting domestic problems. After China and the United States began slapping additional tariffs on one another's exported goods, and with the flare-up of the Zhongxing Telecommunication Equipment Corporation (ZTE) and Huawei incidents, the debate on how to respond to a trade war cleaved between the 'whole nation system school' and the 'market reform school'. As to coping with the technology war, Chinese intellectuals were divided between the paths of 'independent innovation' and 'open innovation'. More recently, in view of the many signs that the China–US trade war could continue indefinitely, and an economic decoupling of the two nations is no longer unimaginable, a fierce debate has arisen between those that advocate full preparations for such economic decoupling and those who insist on further links with the US economy. Although the main themes of the four stages of the debate differ somewhat, they share a certain degree of consistency as regards the conceptual pedigree of the debating parties. Their divergence derives, in essence, from different perspectives on such issues as state power versus market force, independence versus interdependence, and zero-sum competition of power versus win-win economic cooperation. This also exemplifies the competing views in Chinese academia on classical political economy."
Towards naval normalcy: 'open seas protection' and Sino-US maritime relations.,"Wu, Zhengyu",Pacific Review,Taylor & Francis Ltd,MARINE pollution; NAVAL strategy; CHINA; UNITED States; WATER,China's navy; Offshore waters; open seas; sea power; Sino-US relations,"On May 26th, 2015, China published its 10th Defense White Paper which integrated 'open seas protection', along with 'offshore waters defense', into its naval strategy. This shift in naval strategy, albeit largely anticipated, raises a series of important questions about China's maritime ambitions. This article seeks to analyze the causes, nature and challenges of China's latest shift in naval strategy, and its implications for Sino-US maritime relations. The article argues that China's latest shift in naval strategy is a logical corollary of the tension between China's expanding global interests and its asymmetric approach to sea power, and the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) provides the necessary stimulus and justification for such a shift. China's new naval strategy, the paper contends, denotes that it will develop a Mahanian blue-water navy and a basic network of overseas bases in the years ahead. Those two developments are expected to pose a series of significant challenges for China's foreign policy. The article argues that China's new naval strategy presents both challenges and opportunities for China and the world. To accomplish 'open seas protection', China will probably have to modify its policies on a range of issues, and moderate its competitive stance in the near seas. Although China's new naval strategy need not be interpreted in a competitive framework, it does present China with a stark choice: either it pursues more friendly attitudes towards its maritime ambitions by modifying its current policy, or it will be increasingly confronted by a coalition of hostile states."

Tracing the Legacy: China's Historical Aid and Contemporary Investment in Africa.,"Morgan, Pippa; Zheng, Yu",International Studies Quarterly,Oxford University Press / USA,FOREIGN investments; SOCIOHISTORICAL analysis; SOCIAL capital; BUSINESS enterprises; AFRICA -- Foreign economic relations; CHINA -- Foreign economic relations,,"In this article we depart from the classic model of foreign direct investment (FDI) determinants and examine the effect of sociohistorical factors on FDI. We argue that past foreign aid projects confer social capital that constitutes specific resources available to investors in the present, increasing their preferences for host countries in which their home country has accumulated more social capital. We use new data on China's historical aid in Africa to test these contentions, uncovering a positive, significant connection between China's historical aid program in Africa (1956–1999) and contemporary (2000–2015) investments by Chinese companies. While China's historical aid may have been politically driven, it has had important long-term consequences for its commercial investors. More broadly, these findings suggest a sociohistorical explanation of the puzzle of why Chinese foreign investments deviate from conventional FDI patterns."
Trade liberalisation and labour shares in China.,"Kamal, Fariha; Lovely, Mary E.; Mitra, Devashish",World Economy,Wiley-Blackwell,COMMERCE; TARIFF; ESTIMATES; CHINA; WORLD Trade Organization; LABOR; BUSINESS enterprises,China; labour shares; trade liberalisation,"We estimate the extent to which firms responded to tariff reductions associated with China's WTO entry by altering labour's share of value. Firm‐level regressions indicate that firms in industries subject to tariff cuts raised labour's share relative to economy‐wide trends, both through input choices and rent sharing. Our estimates suggest that, on average, an industry that experienced no reductions in output or input tariffs would have a 15.7% lower labour share of value in 2007 than it actually did, assuming the same economy‐wide trends. There is significant variation across firms: the impact attenuates with geographic remoteness and union presence and strengthens with foreign ownership."
Trade of China and India with Africa after the 2008 Financial Crisis.,"NOWAK, WIOLETTA",Insight Turkey,Insight Turkey,INTERNATIONAL trade; INTERNATIONAL economic relations; ECONOMIC development; ECONOMIC policy; DEVELOPING countries,,"The paper analyses the trade competition between China and India in Africa over the period from 2008 to 2017. After the 2008 financial crisis, China increased its advantage over India in exports of goods to rich African countries and in imports of goods from resource-abundant Africa's least developed countries. China-Africa and India-Africa trade relations are win-win relations. However, African countries are becoming more and more dependent on the condition of the Chinese economy. Compared to Chinese exports, Indian ones destroy fewer African markets."
Trafficking of Myanmar women for forced marriage in China.,"Qiu, Geping; Zhang, Sheldon X.; Liu, Weidi","Crime, Law & Social Change",Springer Nature,ORGANIZATIONAL structure; JUSTICE administration; BURMA; CHINA; FORCED marriage; JOB vacancies; JOB offers,,"Trafficking of foreign women into China for forced marriage, once unheard of in China, has ceased to surprise the general public with frequent news stories about women from Vietnam, Myanmar, and North Korea being deceived and sold as brides into the interior of China. Using data extracted from official sources in the Chinese judicial system, we analyzed a total of 73 court cases involving 184 Myanmar women who were trafficked into China, spanning a period of 13 years (2003 through 2016). We found people of diverse backgrounds participated in the trafficking business, most were of low education and unemployed or underemployed. Little formal organizational structures appeared to be needed in these trafficking activities. The vast majority of traffickers were Chinese nationals, who seemed well-connected with the cross-border trade as well as traditional matchmaking business. Most trafficking occurred under the guise of employment opportunities, in which Myanmar women were offered jobs in interior China. The majority of victims appeared to have been recruited from inside Myanmar, and wound up being trafficked to three Chinese provinces (Henan, Anhui, and Shandong). Policy implications as well as Data limitations are also discussed."
Transfer-Based Decentralization and Poverty Alleviation: Evidence from a Quasi-Experiment in China.,"Su, Fubing; Li, Ming; Tao, Ran",Publius: The Journal of Federalism,Oxford University Press / USA,POVERTY reduction; FEDERAL government; COUNTY government; DECENTRALIZATION in management; REGRESSION discontinuity design,,"China launched a massive poverty alleviation program in the 1990s that focused on nationally designated poverty counties. By injecting earmarked transfers with clear spending mandates, the central government hoped for major investments in productive capacities in the poverty counties so they could develop sustainably. Comparing fiscal data of county governments through a regression discontinuity approach, we show that the opposite was true. Poverty county officials failed to make extra investments in production-oriented areas while diversion of central transfers for administrative consumption was rampant. This article develops a better empirical strategy to challenge some earlier findings. Theoretically, this article offers a different case of elite capture under a non-democratic regime. Our focus on poverty regions also reveals the importance of maintaining bureaucratic support in local politics. It complements the popular notion that Chinese local officials are mostly geared toward growth."

This is still widely accepted, and the aim of this paper is to challenge this view by analyzing 657 estimates from 48 production function studies. Our results confirm a positive yet small average output elasticity of transport network, but further add to the literature by showing that the marginal returns of transport infrastructure have been falling since 1950s, especially in the USA and China, while the output elasticities in Europe have been stable but low throughout the entire period. Furthermore, the paper reviews studies on the effects of new roads on firm-level performance, and concludes, based on the evidence of small marginal returns of transport infrastructure on both macro- and micro-economic level, that a a much more targeted approach to public investment in transport infrastructure is needed, at least in the developed countries."
Traversing the soft/hard power binary: the case of the Sino-Japanese territorial dispute.,"Hagström, Linus; Pan, Chengxin",Review of International Studies,Cambridge University Press,SOFT power (Social sciences); HARD power; BOUNDARY disputes; CHINA-Japan relations; RELATIONISM,Diaoyu/Senkaku Islands; Disciplinary Power; Productive Power; Sino-Japanese Relations; Soft Power,"Soft power and hard power are conceptualised in International Relations as empirically and normatively dichotomous, and practically opposite – one intangible, attractive, and legitimate, the other tangible, coercive, and less legitimate. This article critiques this binary conceptualisation, arguing that it is discursively constructed with and for the construction of Self and Other. It further demonstrates that practices commonly labelled and understood as soft power and hard power are closely interconnected. Best understood as 'representational force' and 'physical force' respectively, soft and hard power intertwine through the operation of productive and disciplinary forms of power. We illustrate this argument by analysing the Sino-Japanese dispute over the Diaoyu/Senkaku Islands. Both governments exercise representational force in constructing their respective versions of events and Self/Other. The soft/hard power binary itself plays a performative role as the Self is typically associated with soft power and the Other with hard power. The operation of productive power, moreover, privileges the attractiveness of the former and the repellence of the latter, and disciplinary power physically enforces these distinctions on subjects in both states. Finally, reinforced Self/Other distinctions legitimise preparations for violence against the Other on both sides, thus exposing how fundamentally entangled soft and hard power are in practice."
Trends in Economic Inequality and Its Impact on Chinese Nationalism.,"Chen, Rou-Lan",Journal of Contemporary China,Taylor & Francis Ltd,EQUALITY; ECONOMIC policy; NATIONALISM; POPULISM; POLITICAL science; CHINA -- Politics & government; CHINA,,"In 2016, the Brexit referendum and Donald Trump's electoral victory once again brought xenophobic nationalism into the world spotlight. Surprisingly, in the United Kingdom and the United States, a dramatic increase in wealth inequality impelled the working poor to cling more tightly to nationalism. In recent times, China has also witnessed this correlation of resurgent nationalist aspirations and an increasing gap between rich and poor. In light of these international developments, the primary objective of this study is to explore how China's increasing inequality is influencing Chinese nationalism. The question of whether the Chinese youth who agonize over the trend of wealth inequality has paradoxically grown more attached to Chinese nationalism is also intriguing. Based on structural equation modeling, the estimated results show that, conversely, the increase in economic inequality in China has led to a decline in Chinese nationalism. In particular, disaffected Chinese youth with higher education who suffer from increasing economic disparity have been reluctant to embrace nationalism."

One manifestation of this shift in demand is an increase in eating food prepared outside the home. The objectives of this paper are (a) to gather and analyze data on trends in expenditures on food prepared away from home and (b) to understand how these trends might be affecting estimates of rice consumption. The data from national household surveys of seven countries (Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam and China) were analyzed. The results suggest a positive income elasticity of demand in urban areas and for most countries in East and Southeast Asia, although trends are different in South Asia. Eating out appears to be more common in China and Southeast Asia than in South Asia, even after controlling for income. Constructing estimates of rice eaten outside the home is difficult, and better data collection is essential as it becomes more common to eat food prepared outside the home."

In the face of Beijing's continuing pressure on Taiwan, Washington and Taipei took steps to strengthen relations and celebrate the 40th anniversary of the Taiwan Relations Act (TRA). In Congress, members proposed new measures, some of which challenge the established framework for US relations with Taiwan and China. Beijing repeatedly protested these efforts and in April sent two PLA fighters deliberately across the midline of the Taiwan Strait for the first time in 20 years in an ill-defined warning. In Taiwan, maneuvering for the 2020 elections has begun creating a confusing situation with unclear implications for cross-strait and US-Taiwan relations."
Trump Administration Continues Trade Negotiations with Major Trade Partners.,,American Journal of International Law,Cambridge University Press,INTERNATIONAL trade; UNITED States -- Foreign economic relations,,"In the fall of 2019, the Trump administration reached several trade arrangements, some of them tentative, with important U.S. trade partners. On October 11, 2019, China and the United States announced a preliminary trade deal subject to finalization—one that came after more than a year of escalating tariffs. Just a week earlier, the United States had signed two trade agreements with Japan, one regarding tariff reductions and the other regarding digital trade. None of these deals appear to require subsequent congressional approval in the eyes of the executive branch, unlike the earlier United States-Mexico-Canada-Agreement (USMCA), which was signed in November 2018 and whose fate in Congress appears promising as of mid-December of 2019. In addition to these trade arrangements, the fall of 2019 saw several developments in trade relations between the United States and the European Union tied to the long-running trade disputes."
Trump power: Maximum pressure and China's sanctions enforcement against North Korea.,"Kim, Inhan",Pacific Review,Taylor & Francis Ltd,"SANCTIONS (International law); NORTH Korea-United States relations; KOREA (North) -- Foreign relations; CHINA -- Foreign relations; TRUMP, Donald, 1946-",China; maximum pressure; North Korea; Sanctions; strategic patience; the United States,"China has started choking off the flow of financial resources entering North Korea by blocking North Korea's export of natural resources and other industrial products since early 2017. What has pushed Beijing to enforce sanctions strictly, in contrast with its loose administration of sanctions in the past? By employing principal-agent theory, this article shows that Beijing's conformity to sanctions depends on China's own need and the degree of pressure from Washington for sanctions enforcement. Until the end of the Obama administration, China did not act meaningfully for sanctions enforcement, as the pressure from Washington was weak and North Korea's nuclear capabilities remained limited. Now, international contexts have dramatically changed. Beijing feels a need to discipline Pyongyang with sanctions as Pyongyang has become a de facto nuclear weapon state. The new Trump administration in Washington has also pushed Beijing to do more to rein in Pyongyang's weapon programs."

The 'reactive state' model developed to understand Turkey's political economic transitions is relevant to the new era of 'developmentalism' with authoritarian features. Global shifts coupled with important domestic political shifts are at the heart of the new developmental trajectory. The growing importance of the Russia–China axis, with the relative decline of the West, has been making a key impact in filling the vacuum in the European periphery. Turkish experience is a striking illustration of this broader tendency. Comparative historical experience is utilized to understand the key features of the new era in Turkey. Comparisons are made with the early AKP era and attention is drawn to broad parallels with Russian development experience since early 1990s. A key element here is the process of 'extensive' growth, based on different resource configurations. Land and construction activities constitute a key engine in the Turkish context, contrary to the dominant role of oil and gas in Russia. Finally, the paper probes into challenges of sustainability which raise questions concerning the AKP's extraordinary durability as a hegemonic force in Turkish politics over the past 16 years."

U.S. 'Minilateralism' in Asia and China's Responses: A New Security Dilemma?,"Wuthnow, Joel",Journal of Contemporary China,Taylor & Francis Ltd,INTERNATIONAL cooperation; INTERNATIONAL relations; DEPENDENCY theory (International relations); INTELLIGENCE sharing; BILATERAL treaties; CHINA-United States relations,,"A key feature of Asia's evolving strategic landscape is U.S. efforts to promote policy coordination and interoperability among its allies and partners, through dialogues, exercises, intelligence-sharing agreements, and other means. Though useful in addressing practical issues and underscoring shared values, a concern is that these 'minilateral' activities could exacerbate Chinese fears of 'encirclement' and lead to strategic or economic counter-moves. However, this article suggests that a new 'security dilemma' in Asia is not likely. Although Chinese officials and analysts are apprehensive about U.S. bilateral alliance developments, they have largely discounted the emergence of an 'Asian NATO' under U.S. stewardship. This is due to perceived divergences between U.S. allies, many states' economic dependence on China, and U.S. self-restraint. This should open possibilities for greater minilateral cooperation under most conditions."

It examines trends since 2009 in three domains fundamental to identifying whether shifts are underway in Japan's strategic orientation vis-à-vis China: security policy (primary), trade/investment, and public opinion. Despite deepening uncertainty (and volatility), especially in 'the Trump era', this study finds negligible evidence of hedging behavior: e.g. realigning toward Beijing or adopting a 'middle position', much less developing any meaningful security ties with China. Rather, contemporary trends point in the opposite direction: Japan's China strategy primarily centers on strengthening indigenous deterrence capabilities, bolstering the US–Japan alliance, and diversifying regional security ties beyond Beijing. Even the latter, somewhat paradoxically, aims to deepen ties with Washington and to keep it actively engaged in regional affairs."

While the US has withdrawn from the deal and the other signatories to the deal are trying to keep Iran in the deal, Iran sees little return in remaining part of the deal. Hence, there is uncertainty about its survival. To study the future of JCPOA, the paper analyzes the future course of action of Iran, the EU and the US vis-à-vis the deal. It looks at US efforts to scuttle the deal, the internal and external pressures on Iran to abide or abandon the deal, and the EU's attempts to appease the US while keeping Iran in the deal. Furthermore, it looks at the bilateral relations between stakeholders and predicts the consequences of the course of action taken by each stakeholder."
"Uncertainty, Shifting Power and Credible Signals in US-China Relations: Why the ""Thucydides Trap"" Is Real, but Limited.","Yoder, Brandon K.",Journal of Chinese Political Science,Springer Nature,PREEMPTIVE attack (Military science); WAR; POWER (Social sciences); TRUTHFULNESS & falsehood; INTERNATIONAL relations; CHINA-United States relations,Credible signaling; Power transitions; Preventive war; Security dilemma; US-China relations,"Is conflict between a rising China and a declining United States inevitable? One of the main purported drivers of the ""Thucydides Trap"" is that declining states face intractable uncertainty about rising states' future intentions. Since a declining state cannot be sure how a rising state will use its power in the future, the decliner faces strong incentives to initiate preventive action, possibly war, to forestall the power shift, even if the rising state has behaved cooperatively to date. A common conclusion is therefore that preventive war is often unavoidable under large power shifts, even between states with truly compatible goals. Drawing on recently-published formal work, this paper argues that the uncertainty underpinning the Thucydides Trap is not as pervasive as conventional wisdom holds. Indeed, even under large power shifts, rising states' cooperative signals should be sufficiently credible that preventive war should not occur when the declining state is initially uncertain of the riser's intentions. Rather, preventive war should occur only if the declining state has high confidence that the riser's intentions are truly hostile. The analysis yields two main conclusions. First, China's cooperation has been sufficiently credible to avert preventive war, but not to avoid a substantial degree of competition with the US, which has rationally hedged against China's rising power. However, American observers have often misinterpreted the credibility of both cooperative and non-cooperative Chinese signals, and the current US government is far too confident that China harbors hostile intentions. This leaves open the possibility of a US-China war due to psychological misperceptions."
Underlying Factors of Cambodia's Bandwagoning with China's Belt and Road Initiative.,"Leng, Thearith",East Asia: An International Quarterly,Springer Nature,BELT & Road Initiative; BALANCE of power; CAMBODIA; BANDWAGON effect; CHINA -- Foreign relations,Bandwagoning; Belt and road initiative; Cambodia; Indo-Pacific strategy; John Spanier,"This article examines Cambodia's backing of China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). Having explored bilateral historical ties, the author concludes that Cambodia has pursued a bandwagoning policy with China for most of its post-colonial period since 1953. At present, Cambodia's bandwagoning policy with China has been manifested in the former's support of the latter's initiative. It begs a question as to why the kingdom has enthusiastically supported it. The article elucidates the motives behind Cambodia's bandwagoning policy on BRI applying John Spanier's three level of analytical framework. First, on the systemic level, it argues that China's bid to expand its influence, the change of balance of power in Southeast Asia, and the clean competition for influence between China and Japan in the Mekong Region have affected Cambodia's policy decision on the BRI. Second, at the nation-state level of analysis, Cambodia perceives BRI as another funding source of infrastructure projects, and a means to achieve its policy goal of becoming an economic hub in the region and to whip up domestic support of the ruling party. Finally, on the decision-making level, the backing of the BRI may stem from Prime Minister Hun Sen's pragmatic views of how to sustain his rule over the country. He might have viewed that economic growth would help to strengthen his ruling. The analysis concludes by identifying some negative repercussions Cambodia has encountered as a result of her support of the BRI."
"Understanding American Power: Conceptual Clarity, Strategic Priorities, and the Decline Debate.","Quinn, Adam; Kitchen, Nicholas",Global Policy,Wiley-Blackwell,POLICY sciences; INTERNATIONAL relations; GRAND strategy (Political science); WORLD politics; STATE power,,"What does it mean for the United States to be powerful? The prospect of a decline in American power, especially relative to a rising China, has attracted considerable scholarly and political attention. Despite a wealth of data, disagreements persist regarding both the likely trajectory of the US‐China balance and the most effective strategy for preserving America's advantage into the future. This article locates the source of these enduring disputes in fundamental conceptual differences over the meaning of power itself. We map the distinct tracks of argument within the decline debate, showing that competing positions are often rooted in differences of focus rather than disputes over fact. Most fundamental is a divide between analyses dedicated to national capabilities, and others that emphasise mechanisms of relational power. This divide underpins how strategists think about the goal of preserving or extending American power. We therefore construct a typology of competing understandings of what it means for America to be powerful, to show that a strategy suited to bolstering American power according to one definition of that goal may not support, and may even undermine, American power understood in other ways. That American leaders would wish to preserve or extend American power is a given. Effective strategy in service of that end, however, requires clear thinking about what it means for America to be powerful. Only then can consistent and coherent choices of priority be made between the distinct strategic alternatives available and the trade‐offs they may require."
Understanding China's 'Belt and Road Initiative': beyond 'grand strategy' to a state transformation analysis.,"Jones, Lee; Zeng, Jinghan",Third World Quarterly,Taylor & Francis Ltd,BELT & Road Initiative; INFRASTRUCTURE (Economics); ECONOMIC policy; STRATEGIC planning; FOREIGN investments; EURASIA; CHINA -- Foreign relations; CHINA -- Politics & government -- 2002-,Belt and Road Initiative; China; governance; grand strategy; investment; state transformation,"China's massive 'Belt and Road Initiative' (BRI) – designed to build infrastructure and coordinate policymaking across Eurasia and eastern Africa – is widely seen as a clearly-defined, top-down 'grand strategy', reflecting Beijing's growing ambition to reshape, or even dominate, regional and international order. This article argues that this view is mistaken. Foregrounding transformations in the Chinese party-state that shape China's foreign policy-making, it shows that, rather than being a coherent, geopolitically-driven grand strategy, BRI is an extremely loose, indeterminate scheme, driven primarily by competing domestic interests, particularly state capitalist interests, whose struggle for power and resources are already shaping BRI's design and implementation. This will generate outcomes that often diverge from top leaders' intentions and may even undermine key foreign policy goals."
Understanding China's Proposal for an ASEAN-China Community of Common Destiny and ASEAN's Ambivalent Response.,"Ha, Hoang Thi",Contemporary Southeast Asia: A Journal of International & Strategic Affairs,ISEAS- Yusof Ishak Institute,FREE will & determinism; REGIONALISM; INTERNATIONAL economic relations; ASEAN; CHINA -- Foreign relations,asymmetrical relations; China; Community of Common Destiny; Sinocentric order,"This article examines the rationales and manifestations of China's vision for an ASEAN-China Community of Common Destiny (CCD). It argues that the ASEAN-China CCD proposal signals the crystallization of a deliberative and invested Chinese strategy for the future of ASEAN-China relations. This strategy aims to reinforce the ongoing power shift in Southeast Asia and engineer a smooth transition to a China-centred regional order against the backdrop of a perceived decline in US influence in the region. In this process, some predilections towards the pre-modern Sino-centric hierarchical regional system have resurfaced as China seeks to renegotiate the normative content of the regional order, and condition ASEAN member states into ""good behaviours"" accordingly. The article also examines the limits of the CCD concept in ASEAN-China relations as manifested by ASEAN's ambivalent and selective responses. The ASEAN-China CCD vision injects a sense of determinism about the inevitability of the intertwined destiny between China and ASEAN member states, using geography, history and Chinese economic power as its basis. However, these push factors could also be burdens in an asymmetrical relationship [End Page 223] which structurally induces ASEAN member states' constant fear of over-dependency and loss of autonomy. The article therefore argues that the ASEAN-China CCD will not be a linear trajectory as ASEAN and most of its member states, while continuing to deepen cooperation and engagement with China, will persistently pursue open regionalism and perpetuate multi-polarity in Southeast Asia."
Understanding Pakistani Public Opinion on China and CPEC: A Quantitative Approach.,"Iqbal, Khuram",Pakistan Horizon,Pakistan Institute of International Affairs,TRADE routes; INFRASTRUCTURE (Economics); INTERNATIONAL cooperation; INTERNATIONAL economic relations; CHINA -- Foreign economic relations; PAKISTAN -- Foreign relations -- 1971-; SILK Road; ASIA,Belt & Road Initiative; China- Pakistan Economic Corridor; public opinion warfare,"Public perceptions matter, especially when it comes to mega developmental projects like CPEC, which can possibly transform the socio-economic and political landscape of a country of more than 200 million people. This paper focuses on the interpretation or perception of China and CPEC among the Pakistani public in real and virtual worlds. The study, based on a survey of a random sample of 385 participants, reflects widespread public support for CPEC as 72 per cent respondents actually believed that CPEC will bring benefits to Pakistan. The data collected in October 2017 indicates that the majority of Pakistanis consider China as a more trustworthy partner than the US, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Iran. Regarding the nature of Pak-China relations, 55 per cent of the respondents termed China-Pakistan friendship as 'interest-based,' which indicates that pragmatism, not emotions, drive the pro-China sentiment among the educated Pakistani public and that the states' narrative of 'higher than the mountains, deeper than the ocean' is received with caution. Analysing how this project is perceived on social media by various sections of society will help in devising the practicality of this project for the two concerned nations."
Understanding Power (Shift) in East Asia: The Sino-US Narrative Battle about Leadership in the South China Sea.,"Weissmann, Mikael",Asian Perspective,Johns Hopkins University Press,SOFT power (Social sciences); SOUTH China Sea; CHINA-United States relations; SOCIAL reality; ECONOMIC conditions in China,China; narratives; power (military); power (political); power shift; power transition; soft power; South China Sea; United States,"In this article I study the competing US and Chinese narratives about the South China Sea. Arguing that the practice of calculating power shifts in terms of the changing distribution of material capabilities is inadequate, I complement existing literature by taking ideational and normative dimensions of power into account. I ask what the alternative Chinese narrative of power and leadership in the South China Sea looks like and how it is perceived by others in comparison with the dominant US narrative. While a ""hard"" power transition is ongoing, China's preferred narrative has yet to become widely accepted and the US narrative will remain dominant for now. Nevertheless, China has been making progress in shifting the narrative of what the future could look like with China's vision for a post-US regional and global order now seen as a possible alternative."
Understanding the Assertiveness of China: From the Annals of History.,"Ratha, Keshab Chandra",IUP Journal of International Relations,IUP Publications,POWER (Social sciences); UNILATERAL acts (International law); AGGRESSION (International law); MILITARY strategy; INTERNATIONAL relations; CHINA -- Foreign relations,,"China has a long history of fomenting a swell of anxiety among its neighbors through the action of unilateralism. As an assertive nation, it tries not only to control territory and the behavior of other states but also to exercise more influence over the organization and management of the world economy. An assertive China is contributing massively in developing military power, especially aerospace power, laying claims on international waters, island territories and air space over South China Sea (SCS) and East China Sea (ECS). China's foreign policy believes in keenly calculated self-interest, at the cost of the international institutions, standards and obligations. The resulting lack of clarity about 'what China is', creates an impression in the minds of outsiders to conceptualize the country's actions as signs of increasing assertiveness. The major thrust of the paper is to explore the main driving forces that lie behind the history of an assertive China. Besides, it makes an objective assessment of China's pattern of behavior in recent decades by identifying and examining its potential assertiveness in various fields."

As a political and strategic concept, it has since 2010 gradually become established in the foreign policy lexicon of some countries, especially Australia, India, Japan and the United States. However, China seems to be reluctant to identify itself as part of the Indo-Pacific; Chinese leaders believe that the US-led Indo-Pacific strategy aims to contain China's rise. While the battle between the two geographical concepts 'Indo-Pacific' and 'Asia–Pacific' may be fairly easily settled in the future, US–China strategic competition has just begun. Will the Indo-Pacific become a battlefield for US–China rivalry? How will China cope with the US 'free and open Indo-Pacific' (FOIP) strategy? How will other regional actors respond to the US–China strategic competition in the Indo-Pacific? What are the strategic implications of the 'Indo-Pacific' concept for regional order transformation? How will the Indo-Pacific be institutionalized, economically, politically and strategically? This article introduces the January 2020 special issue of International Affairs , which aims to address those questions, using both country-specific and regional perspectives. Seven articles focus on the policy responses of major players (Australia, China, India, Indonesia, Japan and ASEAN) to the US FOIP strategy and related US–China rivalry in the region. A further three articles examine the profound implications of Indo-Pacific dynamics for regional institution-building and for geopolitical and geo-economic architecture."
Understanding the educational value of the film Please Vote for Me: The case for a pedagogical course in citizenship education.,"Wong, Mei-Yee",Citizenship Teaching & Learning,Intellect Ltd.,CITIZENSHIP education; UNDERGRADUATES; CHINESE literature; DOCUMENTARY films; PLEASE Vote for Me (Film),citizenship education; curriculum development; democracy; documentary film; Hong Kong; teacher professional development,"Studies have demonstrated the importance of citizenship education for preservice teachers; however, studies on citizenship education pedagogies in university programmes have been rare. This small-scale study furthers the discussions in western and Chinese literature regarding the documentary film Please Vote for Me. By using the film in a citizenship and moral education curriculum course, this study explored undergraduate students' perceptions of using the documentary film Please Vote for Me and their actual learning experiences and outcomes. Data were collected through student interviews, reflective journals and worksheets. The study revealed that, overall, the students appreciated learning by using documentary films; they learned reflection and critical thinking skills and about the concept of democracy. They also discussed the educational topics in the film and reflected on the expected teacher and parent roles of citizenship education. The study provides empirical evidence to supplement the literature on citizenship teaching and learning in teacher education by using a documentary film as a resource."
Understanding the international mobility of Chinese temporary workers.,"Zhang, Hongyong",World Economy,Wiley-Blackwell,LABOR mobility; OVERSEAS Chinese; TEMPORARY employees; SERVICE sector; CHINA -- Foreign economic relations; CONSTRUCTION industry,gravity model; international labour mobility; services trade; temporary workers,"Using unique panel data on the temporary movement of Chinese workers to 191 economies during 1992–2015, I investigate the patterns and determinants of labour mobility in the services trade. I estimate a gravity model of labour mobility in two categories, namely overseas labour services and overseas contracted projects. I find that distance (proxy for migration costs) and income are not the most important determinants of the latter. For overseas contracted projects, the dispatch of workers is not driven by their pure economic aims but by the Chinese government's policies and strategies such as its overseas project promotion policy. Furthermore, I employ the difference‐in‐differences estimation method to investigate the impact of this policy upon labour mobility. The results show that the policy of promoting overseas contracted projects has causal and positive effects on labour mobility in construction‐related sectors."

This study uses census data in 2000 and 2010, and aging population ratios, annual increase rates, and spatial autocorrelation analysis to examine spatial disparities in population aging in China. The results show that the population is more aged and aging more rapidly in rural areas than in urban areas. Spatial clusters of population aging expanded from the east coastal region in 2000, to inland provinces such as Sichuan and Chongqing in 2010. The vulnerable regions in terms of population aging, health status of the elderly population, and economic level at the prefectural level were also identified."

It begins with a review of the attempts before 2011 to establish a foundation for a normal security relationship between the United States and Vietnam, and progresses in the scope and pace of the bilateral relationship in this field. The paper then examines the process of a deepening security relationship between the two countries from 2011 to 2017, focusing on the motivations for increased security cooperation and the developments in five main areas of cooperation, namely maritime security, high-level dialogues, search and rescue, humanitarian assistance and disaster relief, and peacekeeping operations. Finally, this paper looks at the potential and limits of the U.S.-Vietnam security relationship, analyzing the possibilities for building a more balanced and effective security relationship and the limitations of U.S.-Vietnam security cooperation. In conclusion, the authors argue that the years from 2011 to 2017 witnessed new and positive moves in the U.S.-Vietnam security relationship. This is a highly significant development for Vietnam and the United States and an illustration of the fast geostrategic change underway in the Asia-Pacific region in the post-Cold War."
Understanding Trump's Trade Policy with China: International Pressures Meet Domestic Politics.,"Wang, Zhaohui",Pacific Focus,Wiley-Blackwell,COMMERCIAL policy; INTERNATIONAL economic relations; INTERNATIONAL trade disputes; BALANCE of trade; CHINA,neoclassical realism; trade dispute; trade policy; Trump; US–China relations,"The trade confrontation between the United States and China has heightened global concerns that a trade war between the two largest economies would have serious consequences for the world economy. This article suggests employing a neoclassical realist framework to examine Trump's trade policy with China as to best explain the US–China trade disputes since 2018. It argues that Trump's trade policy with China is fundamentally driven by the increasingly competitive US–China relationship, which is influenced by Trump's perception of China as America's primary strategic competitor and concern with the US trade deficit, and reinforced by the Trumpization of the Republican Party under the US domestic polarization. The neoclassical realist analysis suggests that the trade tension embedded in the strategic competition between the two countries is likely to continue for a considerable time."
Unemployment among Land-Losing Farmers in China: Evidence from the 2010 Census.,"Heurlin, Christopher",Journal of Contemporary China,Taylor & Francis Ltd,UNEMPLOYMENT; LABOR market; URBANIZATION; FINANCIAL crises; MIGRANT labor; REAL estate development; CHINA,,"How widespread is unemployment among land-losing farmers in China and what explains regional variations in unemployment? Using census data, this article shows that there were only roughly 1.7 million unemployed land-losing farmers in 2010. Case studies and quantitative analysis demonstrate that unemployment is concentrated in areas that have undergone large-scale land takings, often in the form of 'new cities' or 'university cities.' Less-educated farmers have been unable to compete in urban labor markets and have become unemployed, especially in poorer regions. The postfinancial crisis fiscal stimulus exacerbated these trends, making cities that received funding for rebuilding after the Wenchuan earthquake home to high numbers of unemployed land-losing farmers."
Uneven institutional configurations and sectoral variation in China's socialist market economy: a comparative study of three pillar industries.,"Kim, Yongshin",Pacific Review,Taylor & Francis Ltd,MIXED economy; PETROLEUM industry; INDUSTRIAL policy; CHINA; AUTOMOBILE industry; MACHINERY industry,China; industrial policy; Institution; sectoral variation; state capacity,"By comparing three Chinese pillar industries, automobile, petroleum, and machinery, this paper analyzes how the development of uneven institutional configurations bred sectoral variation in transitional China. In 1994, at the dawn of the Chinese socialist market economy, the State Council issued guidelines for national industrial policy and proposed the enactment of similar growth-promoting policies for all pillar industries. The level of policy enactment and the resulting outcomes, however, vary significantly across the industries. Previous literature on China's rapid industrialization has sought to build a single model encompassing China as a whole, and has emphasized either the state's institutional capacity or China's unique governance mechanisms. This study investigates China's industrialization by taking account of the uneven development of institutional capacity amid macro institutional reforms. Every idea and institution evolved at a different pace in these reforms, and the incremental nature of the reforms further deepened the gaps between sectors. This paper argues that, due to this uneven development, the Chinese state was not strong enough to be considered a developmental state until at least the early 2000s."
Unfaithful allies? US security clients in China-led international institutions.,"Kim, Dong Jung",International Relations of the Asia-Pacific,Oxford University Press / USA,INTERNATIONAL cooperation; PATRON & client; CHINA; CLIENTS,,"This article examines a US security client's decision to support an international institution led by a challenger to its patron's leadership position in the international system. Two factors together shape the client's decision: (i) the nature of the institution led by the challenger and (ii) the position of the client in the regional security environment. I argue that a challenger-led institution that aims to complement rather than compete with the institutional framework of the US-led order is likely to be supported by the client that is only facing a diffused security concern from the challenger. In contrast, the challenger's institution that is designed to compete with US-led institutions will not be supported by the client that is facing a specific security concern from the challenger. This argument is substantiated by case studies of Japanese and South Korean responses to two China-led institutions between 2014 and 2016."
Unfulfilled Promise of Educational Meritocracy? Academic Ability and China's Urban-Rural Gap in Access to Higher Education.,"Li, Angran",Chinese Sociological Review,Taylor & Francis Ltd,MERITOCRACY; RIGHT to education; SKEPTICISM; ACADEMIC ability; HIGHER education -- China,,"Abstract: With the rapid expansion of higher education, educational meritocracy has received both applause and skepticism among scholars, citizens, and policy-makers. Focusing on China's urban-rural gap in college enrollment during the expansion, this study examines the differential effects of academic ability on urban and rural adolescents' college enrollment. Using data from the China Family Panel Studies, the results show that the urban-rural gap in attending academic colleges is largest for adolescents who are at the middle ground of the distribution for academic ability, while the gap in vocational college enrollment is greatest for low-achieving adolescents. Compared to their urban counterparts, the positive effects of academic ability on academic college enrollment are stronger for high-achieving rural adolescents. It has little impact on the likelihood of college enrollment for low-achieving rural adolescents. The results suggest that the major source of China's urban-rural gap in higher education is unequal access to vocational colleges. The findings provide important insights for understanding how structural, cultural, and policy factors perpetuate higher education inequality in China."
Union and Communist Party Influences on the Environment in China.,"Ghorbani, Majid; Gunderson, Morley; Lee, Byron Y.

Our motivation is to see which institution is more effective in making individuals ‘aware’ of environmental issues, expressing a ‘willingness to pay’ to alleviate the problems, and ultimately to ‘act’ on the issue by altering their behaviour. Based on theories of planned behaviour and social learning, we hypothesize that membership in the CPC as well as in the ACFTU fosters an ‘awareness’ of environmental problems and a ‘willingness to make a sacrifice’ to protect the environment, but that members of the ACFTU are more likely than members of the CPC to act on the issue by altering their behaviour. We test our hypothesis based on a nationally representative sample (n = 3112) from the 2010 Chinese General Social Survey (CGSS). Our results indicate that both the Party and the union have positive effects on ‘awareness’ and ‘willingness to pay’, but the union effect is generally stronger and only it (and not the Party) affects individual behaviour toward protecting the environment. Unions in China are generally regarded as having little or no independent power to organize workers and engage in free collective bargaining. Their role is to foster harmony between workers and employers and to co-opt grassroots actions, wildcat strikes and the growth of independent unions, all in the interest of fostering stability and growth. While this is undoubtedly the case, our results are consistent with an emerging view of a more variegated picture of Chinese trade unions that highlights some more positive elements, in our case, fostering ‘actions’ to improve the environment in China."
United Front Work and Mechanisms of Countermobilization in Hong Kong.,"Cheng, Edmund W.",China Journal,University of Chicago Press,SOCIAL stigma; ATTRITION (Military science); EXTRADITION; PREEMPTIVE attack (Military science); CHINESE Communist Party,,"This article examines the Hong Kong regime's mechanisms of countermobilization as a reaction to and preemptive strike against dissent. It reveals how united front work historically rooted in Chinese Communist Party apparatuses has penetrated into Hong Kong. The PRC's Liaison Office in Hong Kong and the Hong Kong government have established a hierarchical yet dispersed platform to combine repression with outsourced contention. Hong Kong's regime demonstrates its resilience in how it and the Liaison Office's united front apparatus recruit nonstate actors to constrain opposition from below through both carrots and sticks. More broadly, the article unpacks how the regime's mechanisms of patronage, counterprotest, attrition, and stigmatization operate. While these regime repertoires have curtailed organized resistance during some periods, they have also eroded the regime's legitimacy, exposing it to the re-eruption of protests. The article concludes by assessing how the pro-government united front alliance was utilized during the unprecedented summer of dissent in 2019 over a proposed extradition law."
United States Dilemma of Strategic Alliance with Pakistan: From 'Policy of Containment' to 'War against Terrorism'.,"Saud, Adam; Sargana, Tauqeer Hussain; Sargana, Mujahid Hussain",Journal of Political Studies,"University of the Punjab, Department of Political Science",TERRORISM; INTERNATIONAL relations; DILEMMA; POWER (Social sciences); PAKISTAN; UNITED States; SOUTH Asians,China; Containment; India; Pakistan; Regional Politics; United States; War on Terror,"This study has questioned the very legitimacy and ability of United States to honor bilateral relations that it commits under strategic partnerships. The investigation makes the point that partner nations with United States are used as a tool to pursue foreign policy priorities in regions of strategic interest. Partner nations are usually vulnerable to United States international influence in political, economic, diplomatic and military domains. United States due to its international leverage most of the time gets an easy way out in the so-called strategic partnerships but at times when partner nations are in need of dire support, Washington prefers to backtrack from its commitments. This paper has considered South Asia as a case study to contest United States context of 'strategic alliance' as a mean to pursue foreign policy priorities with Pakistan. The vulnerabilities of Pakistan time and again have allowed United States to positively negotiate best deals for Washington, which in-turn brought political complications for the partner nation. This study makes the point that nature of bilateral relations between Pakistan and United States are multifaceted, whereas the phenomenon of 'containment of communism' initially the Soviet and now the Chinese had become the most decisive factor behind their strategic orientation. US failure to attain its objectives from Pakistan had always made India the ultimate choice, which in turn uses Washington's leverage to craft South Asian political order in its favor. The study has applied inductive method with that of 'Analytical Eclecticism' approach to evaluate the ups and downs of the two inconvenient strategic allies and decoded the so-called premises of the Indo-US strategic alliance which is founded on the political orchestration to contain Chinese increasing influence."

Beginning in 1916, the national government in Beijing mandated that each province and county throughout the Chinese nation celebrate ""Arbor Day"" in order to foster a modern Chinese environmental culture. This change was made in response to global discourses that linked forest cover to a modern nation's moral and economic health. Arbor Day coincided with the Tomb-Sweeping Festival, a day traditionally reserved for ancestor worship. Due to the vast climatic disparities within China, many governments planted Arbor Day trees under conditions that made it impossible for them to thrive. Nevertheless, officials throughout China continued to celebrate Arbor Day as proof of their loyalty to the government in Beijing. Arbor Day thus served more as an exercise in promoting national unity than in creating a viable reforestation campaign."

Taiwan has built amicable and symbiotic politico‐diplomatic ties with key Mideast countries, developing continuous partnership with them without the privilege of having those instrumental types of attachment. As a result, Taipei occupies a unique position in the international relations of the region. Still, this phenomenon has largely escaped the attention of both academic and policy circles around the world, as major developments in Taiwan's interactions with the Middle East over past decades were hardly recorded or scrutinized. This study probes Taiwan's atypical foreign policy orientation toward the Middle East by looking into critical milestones in Taipei's connections with the region."

US attitudes towards China before and after the Washington Conference based on US mainstream media reports.,"WANG, Di",Journal of Modern Chinese History,Taylor & Francis Ltd,,resolution of the Shandong question; US attitudes towards China; US media; Washington Conference,"The problems China faced in the world order after World War I and the position and measures China took in the tussling between Western countries needs to be analyzed not only using historical records in Chinese and from the perspective of China itself; researchers should also consult foreign documents to determine the attitudes and ways of thinking of other countries, so as to reflect on the choices China needed to make and the roles that Western countries played at that time. Only in so doing can we fully understand how much space and strength China then had to strive for its rights in the international arena. This article examines the social basis of the attitude and policies of the United States (US) towards China in the period between the May Fourth Movement (1919) and the Washington Conference (1921–1922) by focusing on reports on China in the US mainstream media, including the New York Times, the Christian Science Monitor, the Washington Post, and the Los Angeles Times. The US government's attitude towards China was determined by the interests of the United States, the Far East, and the other countries of the world. However, the US mainstream media's reports on China also reflected the values of American society and popular sympathy for China's destiny. When discussing how to support China, the US media distinguished between support for the Chinese government and support for the Chinese people on the way to democracy and governance by law. In this case, the media reflected different views on how to assist China."

It is obvious fact that strategic stability of South Asia is maintained through the US involvement especially after nuclearization hence, balance of power. Even if we discuss the case of Pakistan it is obvious that most of the Pakistan's defense related equipment are either produced by the US or obtained through its financial and political assistance. In this discussion if we ignore the role of China then it will be negligence at our part but facts are never denied and we must know that America has major contributions in strengthening the Pakistan defense mechanism. In this scenario US tilt towards India will put sever impacts on Pakistan militarily and ultimately will lead the whole South Asian region towards the imbalance of power. Because convergence of US interests with India will ultimately lead US to prefer India on political, defense and economic fronts vis-a-vis other states of the region and its side effects will have far reaching implications for regional security."
"US Technological Competition with China: The Military, Industrial and Digital Network Dimensions.","Mori, Satoru",Asia-Pacific Review,Taylor & Francis Ltd,,,"The US approach toward China shifted from engagement to competition, and it has coincided with the near-simultaneous breakthrough of advanced technologies in a whole host of areas ranging from artificial intelligence to synthetic biology. As a result, the United States is competing with China to apply these advanced technologies for military and industrial purposes, and, at the same time, competing in third countries over dominance in digital network infrastructure. The current article will illustrate Chinese efforts and US countermeasures that are unfolding in the form of military technological competition, industrial technological competition, and the digital network competition in order to argue that the US shift toward competition is not only about Chinese discriminatory and unreasonable acts, policies and practices related to technology transfer and cyber intrusions, but a contest for supremacy over the next generation of military, economic and information/data dominance that could impact the relative legitimacy of political and socio-economic system of the two states."

US-China conflict in global trade governance: the new politics of agricultural subsidies at the WTO.,"Hopewell, Kristen",Review of International Political Economy,Taylor & Francis Ltd,INTERNATIONAL trade; AGRICULTURAL subsidies; TRADE negotiation; WORLD Trade Organization; CHINA-United States relations,agricultural subsidies; China; global economic governance; trade; trade negotiations; US; World Trade Organization (WTO),"This article shows how China's rise has radically altered the politics of one of the most prominent and controversial issues in the global trading system: agriculture subsidies. Agriculture subsidies depress global prices and undermine the competitiveness and livelihoods of poor farmers, and therefore have been long seen as a symbol of the injustice of the trading system. The issue has traditionally been understood in North-South terms, with developed countries seen as the perpetrators of harm and developing countries as innocent victims. In this article, however, I challenge this prevailing conception of the agricultural subsidies issue, arguing that it is now out of date and no longer corresponds with the emerging reality. A momentous but underappreciated change has taken place, largely beneath the radar of IPE scholarship: China has emerged as the world's largest subsidizer, profoundly transforming the global politics of agricultural subsidies. From a North-South battle, WTO negotiations on agricultural subsidies are now primarily centered on a conflict between the US and China. While reducing subsidies remains a pressing concern for developing countries, efforts to negotiate new and strengthened disciplines at the WTO have been thwarted by an impasse between the two dominant powers."
Useful ignorance: The benefits of uncertainty during power shifts.,"Haynes, Kyle",International Interactions,Taylor & Francis Ltd,INTERNATIONAL cooperation; GAME theory; INTERNATIONAL relations; RUSSIA-United States relations; CHINA-United States relations,Game theory; power shift; reassurance; signaling; uncertainty,"This paper develops a formal model exploring how declining states allocate scarce military resources across multiple commitments under uncertainty. The model reveals that under certain conditions, states might actually benefit from their own uncertainty. In the model, a declining state's uncertainty creates incentives for a revisionist rising power to misrepresent its intentions. But importantly, this misrepresentation requires the rising state to act cooperatively, implementing policies that immediately benefit the declining state. The model reveals how declining states can exploit these incentives in order to maximize the short-term benefits of their counterpart's cooperation. Under some conditions, the benefits of this deceptive cooperation can outweigh the long-term costs of being deceived. These dynamics do not operate when the declining state is certain of the rising state's type. I illustrate this logic through a case study of Great Britain's pre-WWI naval withdrawal from East Asia."

Based on fieldwork with Chinese tertiary students in the United Kingdom, this article analyses the values – described in interviews by students and their parents and grandparents – that drive these families' overseas higher education strategies. The results show that in contrast to the current (dominant instrumentalist) understandings of international student motivations, some Chinese middle-class families' belief in higher education is about the development of a socialist ideal personhood and the wish to make significant social contributions. Ultimately, the author argues that some Chinese middle-class families are experiencing a transition, from egoism to altruism, and in future, fulfilling Confucian values and making social contributions is highly likely to become part of middle-class subjectivities."

Based on a sample of 1077 students and a quasi-experimental design, this study tests the Marshall hypotheses in China. Except the control group, three intervention essays (on 'international trend', 'wrongful conviction', and 'deterrence') were provided to three experimental groups and students' opinions were surveyed afterwards on capital punishment overall and six specific capital offenses. The results showed that the majority of Chinese students favored capital punishment and the wrongful conviction essay helped significantly reduce students' support in the overall death penalty opinion, consistent with the Marshall hypotheses. Nevertheless, the international trend and deterrence essays boosted students' support when opinions on specific capital offenses were surveyed, producing a counter-effect. Consistent with the hypotheses, students with a retribution belief were more likely to favor capital punishment and less likely to be swayed by essay interventions."

The gradual nature of this military concern has not been studied systematically, in contrast to military modernisation. This paper presents a synthetic framework composed of several indicators to examine military obsolescence. Vietnam has been selected for the application of the framework for its large number of Cold War legacies and the strategic pressure from China. Hanoi's ageing assets would undermine its position vis-à-vis Beijing, and its defence investment policies face the dilemma of choosing to spend more on naval and aerial power, or ameliorating its army which is technologically lacking compared to its Chinese counterpart."
Violence Exposure and Support for State Use of Force in a Non-Democracy.,"Hou, Yue; Quek, Kai",Journal of Experimental Political Science,Cambridge University Press,VIOLENCE; VIOLENCE in the community; INTERNAL security; PUBLIC opinion; CHINA; COMPUTER surveys,China; Public opinion; survey experiment; violence,"How do individuals respond to internal security threats in non-democracies? Does violence make individuals more supportive of a strong state? Are the effects of violence on individual attitudes uniform, or are they heterogeneous with respect to the identity of the perpetrators? We field an online survey experiment on a national sample of Chinese citizens, in which respondents were randomly selected to view reports on violent acts in China. We show that exposure to violence makes individuals more supportive of a strong state: respondents randomly exposed to violence are more likely to approve police use of lethal force, and this effect is particularly strong among the less wealthy Han Chinese. We also find suggestive evidence that individuals exhibit intergroup biases in their reaction to violence."

Through a close reading of these short stories, it becomes possible to consider how the relationship need not result in Chinese neocolonialism and exploitation. Working with the conceptual framework of political friendship, I illustrate how these short stories cumulatively serve to unravel easy distinctions between the friend and the enemy, thereby intimating that, in the future, southern Africa can benefit from approaching China as both friend and enemy."

This article addresses that gap by examining diplomacy, war, and domestic politics in the premodern Vietnam–China relationship under the hierarchic tributary system. Specifically, we construct a unique data set of over 1,200 entries, which measures wars and other violence in the region from 1365 to 1789. The data revealed the stable and legitimate nature of tributary relations between formally unequal political units. The Vietnamese court explicitly recognized its unequal status in its relations with China through a number of institutions and norms. Vietnamese rulers also displayed very little military attention to their relations with China. Rather, Vietnamese leaders were clearly more concerned with quelling chronic domestic instability and managing relations with kingdoms to their south and west."

Not only was the impact deep and enduring, but evolving, regionally and socially divergent responses to the war also shaped the war's military. In modern war, as Karl von Clausewitz pointed out, public morale is a key factor in deciding the outcome of the fighting. The article first sketches the war's impact on the Chinese economy, suggesting that the main consequences were ""demodernization"" and the revival of traditional trading patterns. It then discusses the reading lives of a young woman who grew up during the war and a senior Nationalist official to delineate contrasting emotional private responses, with one person finding in literature an inspirational alternative and the other becoming increasingly disillusioned. The article concludes with an examination of three popular history textbooks. They all stressed the importance of an awareness of Chinese civilization but narrated its nature and its prospects in contrasting ways. Such textbooks were used in required Chinese history courses at universities. The article makes no attempt to be comprehensive but instead uses a few examples as illustrations of the potential of researching wartime everydayness."

Within this overall continuity, new elements became salient. The new policies promulgated by the republican government soon after the success of the 1911 Revolution created an institutional legacy that gave previously marginal ideas enough legitimacy to enter the mainstream. Changes in ""background culture"" also resulted in many new themes associated with May Fourth, though these themes were ostensibly similar to those in the late Qing period. The enlightenment of May Fourth endowed the ""future"" with positive values so that a future-oriented perspective became a fashionable trend in this period."

Because China plays such a large role in handling global recycling flows--including waste from the U.S.--these restrictions are likely to have enormous impacts on trade in recyclables over the long term. The restrictions are potentially vulnerable to challenge within the World Trade Organization (WTO), but challenging the restrictions could create many negative impacts and be seen as an action akin to U.S. imperialism by denying China a right to a healthy environment. The domestic Chinese recyclables trade, however, has seen a great deal of economic benefit already from these restrictions--so it seems difficult to argue that any Chinese restrictions are purely motivated by a desire for a better environment. Additionally, the ongoing trade war between the U.S. and China could complicate any attempt to bring a suit. Although it is likely that the U.S. would be able to win a WTO dispute challenging the Chinese restrictions, the costs of filing a suit outweigh the benefits and the U.S. should not challenge the restrictions."

Drawing from a rich set of individual-level data from the China General Social Survey 2010, we address the question of protest participation by focusing on the factors of resources, and rewards vs risks, that might be unique to protestors in an authoritarian state. We find strong evidence for education, typically conceived as a key enabling resource in protests, to be negatively associated with likelihood of participation. There are, however, significant differences between political behavior in urban and rural samples. We find some, though rather weak, evidence to suggest that as urban residents become wealthier over time, they will increasingly turn to protests as a form of political participation, demanding greater accountability of government and corporate actions."

Since the Chinese central government legalized ridesharing in 2016, cities across provinces have adopted dissimilar strategies in governing ridesharing. In this contribution, we use a fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis approach to explain the variations in regulatory strategies adopted by 25 Chinese capital cities to govern ridesharing. Our study has identified seven paths to explain both the stringent and loose regulation of municipalities on ridesharing. These findings enrich our understanding of the choices of government strategies in regulating ridesharing. We conclude that regulators should adopt a network governance approach to achieve a win–win outcome in governing ridesharing."
"What Factors Determine China's North Korea Policy?: Uncertainty, Instability and Status Quo Risk Management.",Kihyun Lee,Korean Journal of Defense Analysis,Korea Institute for Defense Analyses,,China's North Korea policy; instability; status quo risk management; uncertainty,"China's North Korea policy is a combination of China's strategic goal toward regional order including U.S.--China relations and tactical management over North Korea's crisis action. Since the post--Cold War era, China has preferred the status quo as its regional strategy, which leads them to operate tactical management over North Korea risk. North Korea risk consists of uncertainty, which means uncontrollability of North Korea, and instability, which means the possibility of collapse of the North Korean regime. These risks often play as a crisis of China's status quo strategy, so China is inclined to implement its North Korea Policy to control these crises. The basis of China' North Korea policy is engagement, considering that China has to protect North Korea's conventional and geopolitical values. However, the engagement comes in different forms according to the characteristics of the crisis. The one is coercive engagement, which appears when North Korea's uncertainty prevails over instability. The other one is inclusive engagement, which occurs when North Korea's instability is stronger than uncertainty. This hypothesis can be applied to past and current situations. With this point of view, it is possible to predict the future of China's North Korea policy."

This paper first demonstrates that China's post-socialist transition has given rise to a new gendered structure of power, in response to which urban young women have assembled various discursive and material practices in their struggles. Second, the social rupture and shock caused by these practices have led to the popular perception that an undifferentiated ""feminism"" has been proliferating in contemporary China. Combining historiographical and ethnographic research, this paper maps out the overall landscape of women's agitations and identifies two latent strands of ""made-in-China feminism"" – with varied sociopolitical significance – that engage with cultural norms at the grassroots level. In grasping China's ongoing gender antagonism with its full complexity, this paper discusses the limitations of existing scholarly approaches to contemporary Chinese feminism. This analysis contributes to the ongoing conversation on imagining a feminist politics in non-Western societies that disrupts the political, economic, and cultural orders all at once."

What Money Can Buy: Perceived Economic Security in China.,"Kweon, Yesola; Choi, ByeongHwa",Journal of Contemporary China,Taylor & Francis Ltd,ECONOMIC security; SOCIAL policy; UNEMPLOYMENT insurance; UNEMPLOYMENT statistics; CHINA,,"Many studies emphasize the authoritarian bargain to explain why authoritarian regimes develop social welfare in the absence of democratic accountability. Increased welfare support enhances economic security and, in turn, strengthens public support for the regime. However, few studies have empirically demonstrated the core part of the underlying mechanism that welfare support leads to reduced economic insecurity in non-democratic regimes. By analyzing survey data from China, this study examines how labor market programs affect public economic insecurity. The results reveal that vocational training has a U-shaped impact on risk perception. It alleviates perceived insecurity when the unemployment rate is at the low or high end and has negligible effects at the medium level of unemployment rates. Furthermore, the impact of vocational training is particularly strong for individuals with higher incomes, urban hukou, and public sector employment. In contrast, regardless of the unemployment rate, unemployment insurance has a negative effect on risk perception overall. The results show that the type of social policy and macro- as well as micro-level socio-economic attributes should be taken into account to understand the impact of social welfare."

Yet there is insufficient research tracing the precise mechanisms linking economic relationships between a ""sender"" and ""target"" state to actual influence in the security domain. We offer three contributions. First, we map out the theoretical mechanisms of influence in a sender–target relationship. Second, we empirically investigate these mechanisms through a case study of China's economic influence in Sri Lanka since 2009. Third, we use our findings to generate new insights on the mechanisms of influence in the economic statecraft literature and the dynamics of great-power competition in South Asia. Beijing's ability to convert its considerable economic resources into strategic influence in Sri Lanka is currently hampered by the poor planning and implementation of infrastructure projects, domestic politics, and Sri Lanka's relationship with India, a regional competitor and rising power."

Despite all the concerns regarding the stability of the region, Indonesia is neither strengthening its power projection capability nor building a coalition to address China's growing power in the South China Sea. Indonesia's underbalancing behavior is the result of a strategic culture that influences its military and foreign policy thinking on threat perceptions and economic considerations, limiting the options that Indonesia can take vis‐à‐vis China. As a result, China as a state is not seen as a major, direct, and immediate threat that would warrant immediate action that may in turn jeopardize Indonesia's larger interest. Instead, domestic politics and security—especially public perceptions of how the government's friendship with China may benefit or hurt the government—remains the focus and the priority of the government."
What U.S. Navy strategists and defense planners should think about in the era of maritime great power competition.,"Haynes, Peter",Defense & Security Analysis,Taylor & Francis Ltd,,China; great power competition; Maritime strategy; naval strategy; U.S. Navy,"For the first time in a generation, the US Navy finds itself in an era of great power competition.

Absorbed with the day-to-day tasks associated with managing how the fleet is being built, operated, and rationalised, these busy officers and civilians seldom can step back and gain some perspective on fundamental aspects of the security environment and relate those to naval purpose. To that end, this article provides a primer on what to keep in mind and how to think in an era of maritime great power competition."
"When balance of power meets globalization: China, India and the small states of South Asia.","Paul, T. V.",Politics,Sage Publications Inc.,ECONOMIC globalization; INDIA; CHINA; INVESTMENTS; FINANCIAL globalization,balancing; China; India; South Asia,"This article addresses the research question: how have most small states of South Asian region managed to acquire substantial amount of investment from China and India without falling into the strategic orbit of either power? This is an anomaly because most structural theories, in particular neorealism, would expect small states not to have much power and influence on their own in their relationship with powerful states. I answer this puzzle by arguing that the limited competition between China and India in an era of intensified economic globalization has provided a window of opportunity to small states to maximize their returns from the two without upsetting their relationship with either in a big way. This short-term bargaining window has been facilitated by the managed rivalry and economic interdependence between China and India which is yet to become an intense strategic rivalry. The article cautions that as the Chinese and Indian ambitions in the Indo-Pacific collide, the smaller states may be asked to make choices akin to bandwagoning with either one, in particular by offering military bases and naval facilities. This development, if it occurs, will drastically affect the bargaining power of the smaller states."
When courts refuse to play by the rules (of law): the failure of public administration theory in securing constitutional rights.,"Gould, Jon",Journal of Chinese Governance,Taylor & Francis Ltd,POLITICAL science; LAW; COURTS; LAWYERS; UNITED States; UNITED States. Constitution. 6th Amendment; UNITED States. Supreme Court; CRIMINAL convictions,criminal justice; judicial administration; Rule of law,"If there is any area of government in which one would expect to locate the rule of law, it would be in the courts. And, if there is any group of people deserving the protections of the rule of law, it would be the accused unable to afford an attorney. In the United States of America, the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution provides a right to assistance of counsel, and both Supreme Court precedent and federal statute extend that right to indigent defendants in criminal cases while establishing that the representation provided is at least minimally effective. However, while these rights exist on paper, their protection has gone wanting in practice as the competing goals of federal judicial administration have starved indigent defense of sufficient funding and have failed to ensure that the attorneys and representation provided are adequate. Indeed, as federal judicial administration has become more 'professionally' focused - deferring to the administrative expertise of staff members and emphasizing cost-effective, results-oriented management - indigent criminal defendants have seen the adequacy of their representation fall, in turn threatening the rule of law. This paper tells that story by simultaneously explaining the growth of judicial administration at the federal level in the United States and showing how the federal courts' increased focus on bureaucratic processes and staff expertise in cost containment have endangered the most vulnerable parties in the federal criminal cases. As such, the federal courts' over-reliance on public administration theory and their failure to balance its implementation with other central goals threatens the rule of law in their very courtrooms. There is a way out of this morass, which a committee of the federal courts has even recommended: independence of the defense function from the courts' administrative structures. Barring that change, a central constitutionally-protected right will remain at risk."

The Case of the BRIC Acronym.,"Linsi, Lukas; Schaffner, Florian",New Political Economy,Taylor & Francis Ltd,FOREIGN investments; MARKETING; CAPITAL market; CAPITAL movements; INVESTMENTS,BRICs; emerging markets; foreign direct investment; Investment heuristics; portfolio equity investment,"Several recent publications have argued that the use of heuristics by financial investors can distort global capital flows, but scholars have paid little attention to the scope conditions that determine when heuristics become influential (and when they don't). Building on work in economic sociology and behavioural finance we suggest that the degree to which investment heuristics can bias aggregate capital flows depends on the levels of uncertainty and self-referentiality that structure the environments under which investment decisions are being made. Applying these insights to the two principal global markets for corporate investment, we argue that the institutional structure of markets for short-term portfolio equity investments (PEI) is far more conducive to trigger the mimetic adoption of a specific heuristic than in markets for long-term foreign direct investments (FDI). To test this hypothesis, we leverage the high level of arbitrariness of the selection of Brazil, Russia, India and China into the BRIC acronym and empirically examine the impact of its remarkable rise to prominence among communities of financial investors in the mid-2000s on global capital flows to emerging economies. In line with the theoretical argument, we find robust evidence of a strong BRIC-bias in markets for PEI but not FDI."

Yet international laws and policies need to be ""translated"" to suit domestic political institutions and newly adopted policies may challenge or contradict preexisting domestic policies, institutions, and interests. To explore the domestic impact of international institutional developments, we studied the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) Convention for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage and its adoption in four countries (Japan, China, France, and Germany). Using historical institutionalism, this comparative case study sheds light on the effects of the Convention on cultural governance systems in two supposedly different ""camps"" within the UNESCO: the East and the West. The study argues that it is the interaction and entangled relationship of exogenous and endogenous factors over time, particularly the timing and sequence in which they constrain and facilitate change, which shape actors' preferences and institutional development at both levels.

Zhongguo ren min jie fang jun; CHINA -- Relations -- France; FRANCE -- Relations; YANNE, Jean",China; comedy; film; Georges Pompidou; Jean Yanne,"This article looks at two seemingly disparate events: Georges Pompidou's 1973 presidential visit to the People's Republic of China (PRC) and the filming and release of Jean Yanne's blockbuster comedy Les Chinois à Paris (1974). Both produced flawed visions of Franco-Chinese relations. During Pompidou's visit, officials and the press attempted to demonstrate that France enjoyed warmer relations with the PRC than any other Western nation. Yanne's film parodied the French fad for Maoism by imagining the People's Liberation Army invading and occupying Paris. His film caused an uproar in the press and sparked official Chinese protest. The article ultimately argues that the two events were deeply related, part of a wave of popular and official interest in China in the early 1970s that extended well beyond the well-known stories of student and intellectual Maoists. This interest paved the way for Franco-Chinese relations as we know them today."
When the rule of law met rule by the party: the conflicts between Baptist schools and the local Guomindang in Republican Suzhou.,"BEN, CHEN",Journal of Modern Chinese History,Taylor & Francis Ltd,,Baptist schools; local court; local Guomindang; rule by the party; Suzhou; the rule of law,"This study examines the relationship between the Guomindang (GMD) and the courts by focusing on the 1929 conflicts between the Suzhou Baptist schools and the local GMD party apparatus. The GMD regime supported the principle of rule by the party. At the local level, the GMD's rise was often stymied by the independent judiciary whose judgments were based on the principle of the rule of law. The local party might not have been able to control the local court in the early years of the GMD regime, but it did steadily alter state-society relationships, as it could benefit from the local court's commitment to the rule of law. For instance, the district court in Suzhou actively defended the principle of rule by the party in conflicts between Baptist schools and the local party because the GMD had made that principle the law of the land."

Which foreign states support the global use of the Chinese renminbi?

This paper conducts a cross‐country analysis of the factors that have led foreign governments to introduce three primary policy infrastructures to support renminbi use—renminbi swap lines, Renminbi Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor quotas and renminbi clearing banks. Our analysis shows that a state holding renminbi assets among its reserves or having more developed financial markets is likely to establish a higher level of policy infrastructure supporting renminbi use. We also find that a country's economic and political relations with China may have meaningful impacts on the level of its establishment of those renminbi‐related policy infrastructures. These findings significantly expand our understanding of renminbi internationalisation, by identifying which non‐Chinese factors have affected its progress to date. They also contribute meaningfully to the literature on currency internationalisation and international currencies in general, by calling attention to the roles of foreign states in the process of a currency's internationalisation."

This study examines asset-poverty rates in China using the 2013 survey data from the Chinese Household Income Project (CHIP). The results indicate that asset-poverty rates in urban China were lower than those of developed countries, whereas rural and migrant households experienced more serious asset poverty than their counterparts in urban China. In addition, the asset-poverty rates were at least twice the income-poverty rates in China according to the different poverty lines used in the study. Several demographic characteristics were found associated with asset poverty. To assist the Chinese government in reaching its goal of eradicating absolute poverty by 2020 through targeted poverty alleviation, this study suggests including assets in the description and alleviation of poverty."
WHO ARE THE INFLUENTIALS IN CHINA'S CYBERSPACE AND WHAT DO THEY SAY ABOUT THE ISSUE OF SINO-JAPANESE RELATIONS?,"Guan, Tianru",Journal of East Asian Studies,Cambridge University Press,CYBERSPACE; PRAGMATISM; CHINA; CHINA-Japan relations; INTERNET security,China's cyberspace; online influential; Sino-Japanese relations,"This research note explores an increasingly prominent, but often neglected, communication group in China's cyberspace—the online ""influential"" (big Vs or verified users)—who shape public perceptions, including on foreign policy issues. Examining threads on Sino-Japanese relations on Weibo reveals a diverse ecosystem that includes not only established media agencies and government agencies, but public intellectuals, whose role and presence are quite central. An analysis of the content of posts finds that influentials have similarly diverse viewpoints on Sino-Japanese relations; some have broken with the conflict-focused discourses that have prevailed on Weibo, reflecting a competing narrative espousing the need for greater pragmatism towards Japan. The findings call into question the argument that social media necessarily trends toward greater nationalism."

Moreover, by locating lexical items in the co-texts and checking the collocates, we have tried to find referents of we against changing socio-political contexts. The meaning of we has changed from representing Chinese compatriots on the Chinese mainland and the revolutionary militia in CKS's speeches to an over-inclusion and more hearer-dominant (HD) we in CCK's speeches. A ""wandering we"" was found in LTH's speeches with which a well-defined national collectivity was difficult to identify in the late 1980s."

The Superpowers and the Cold War in the Middle East, 1969–77.","Jackson, Galen",International Security,MIT Press,COLD War & politics; INTERNATIONAL security; GREAT powers (International relations); MIDDLE East; SOVIET Union-United States relations,,"Standard explanations for the demise of U.S.-Soviet détente during the 1970s emphasize the Soviet Union's inability to put aside its communist ideology for the sake of a more cooperative relationship with the United States. Soviet resistance to reaching a stable accommodation during this period, many analysts maintain, was especially evident in the Middle East, where Moscow is said to have embraced the ""radical Arab program"" vis-à-vis Israel. Such accounts do not fare well, however, in light of the historical evidence. Instead, that evidence indicates that the Soviet Union was eager to cooperate with the United States to achieve an Arab-Israeli agreement. The Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford administrations, however, were not interested in working with the Soviets in the Middle East, and instead sought to expel them from the region. These findings have important implications for scholarly debates about whether great power rivals can cooperate on issues where their strategic interests are overlapping, as well as for contemporary debates over U.S. policy toward countries such as China, Iran, North Korea, and Russia."
Who's in charge of Sino-African resource politics? Situating African state agency in Ghana.,"Phillips, Jon",African Affairs,Oxford University Press / USA,BILATERAL treaties; INTERNATIONAL economic assistance; ECONOMIC structure; AFRICA-China relations; CHINESE investments,,"Recent literature on Sino-African resource politics emphasizes the agency of African elites in relation to Chinese capital and state agencies, yet whether African elites have gained agency over the structure of African economies remains debatable. This article questions how agency has been understood in analyses of Sino-Africa relations by identifying the nature and limits of Ghanaian agency in bilateral and multilateral aid relations since the discovery of oil in 2007. First, although the agency of Ghanaian elites has shaped the outcomes of recent bilateral investments, Ghanaian state agency has been exercised primarily in brokering external sources of finance and in relation to domestic institutions and political factions. Second, Chinese investment did shift the aid modalities and the relative power of Ghana's traditional development partners, but international finance institutions and US agencies maintained influence over macro-economic governance and sectoral policy, respectively. As such, the scope of Ghanaian agency in relation to external finance and bilateral and multilateral relations was narrow, and market orthodoxies of development remained dominant. Undue attribution of agency over economic and political structures can be avoided by situating African agency within the social and material context of transnational industries."
"Whose 'Freedom of Navigation'? Australia, China, the United States and the making of order in the 'Indo-Pacific'.","Wirth, Christian",Pacific Review,Taylor & Francis Ltd,LIBERTY; WORLD politics; AUSTRALIA; UNITED States; SOUTH China Sea,Australia; China; Freedom of navigation; order; US,"The so-called freedom of navigation through the Malacca straits and the South China Sea, some of the world's busiest trade routes, has long been of concern to scholars and practitioners of international politics in the region. Increasing tensions around territorial disputes recently propelled the issue to the forefront of global foreign and security policy making. Yet, despite the frequent invocation of threats to the 'freedom of navigation' for the justification of military measures to protect the 'liberal rules-based order', the substance of this rule or norm remains ambiguous and the nature of the threatened order unclear. Located at the confluence of the Indian and Pacific Oceans, Australian discourses represent a suitable case for clarifying both. Starting from the original provisions on navigational regimes in international law, this study analyses the meanings that officials, think tank analysts and academics have been attributing to the freedom of navigation and contextualize them in the evolving debate about order. Focusing on political rather than legal discourses, it finds that concerns with the freedom of navigation are largely unrelated to the safety of maritime transport. Instead, they serve as proxy for an increasingly static imagination of international order – written backward in time – to be secured."
Why are African Countries interested in Chinese Development Finance? Evidence from contemporary Kenya.,"Otele, Oscar M.; Etyang, Oita",African Review,"University of Dar es Salaam, Department of Political Science & Public Administration",GEOPOLITICS; INTERNATIONAL economic assistance; AFRICA-China relations; FINANCE; INVESTMENTS,Africa; China; development; finance; Kenya,"In response to China's renewed engagement in Africa, the existing literature on ""China-Africa relations"" conflates African interests in Chinese development finance with other drivers of engagement like trade and investments. As such the literature points out solidarity; diversification of economic partners, regime stability, strategic partnership and exemplar for development experience as some of the motivations behind African interests in Chinese development finance. However, these themes tend to generalize all African states as a monolithic entity despite the diversity on the continent reflected in the geo-politics of individual states, thus obfuscating specific reasons some countries are interested in Chinese development finance. To ameliorate this deficit in the literature, this article seeks to understand why successive governments in Kenya since 2003 preferred Chinese development finance. It was established that ""noninterference"", ""no-strings attached'', Kenya's quest to diversify her external sources of foreign aid, the mutual conception of developmental aspiration and ""few"" bureaucratic procedures are some of the reasons why Kenya is interested in Chinese development finance."
Why Do Chinese Democrats Tend to Be More Nationalistic? Explaining Popular Nationalism in Urban China.,"Zhong, Yang; Hwang, Wonjae",Journal of Contemporary China,Taylor & Francis Ltd,NATIONALISM; POPULISM; ETHNIC relations; CHINA; CHINA -- Politics & government; CULTURAL appropriation; ETHNOLOGY -- China,,"Popular nationalism remains strong in China. What drives this strong nationalistic sentiment? This is the key question this study attempts to answer. The authors are particularly interested in the connection between domestic politics and outward nationalist feelings among Chinese urban residents, specifically the relationship between democratic orientation and regime support on the one hand and nationalist feelings on the other. Descriptive findings from random survey data on Chinese urban residents in 34 Chinese cities reveal that democracy-oriented Chinese urbanites tend to show stronger nationalistic feelings. A large volume of literature on the relationship between democratic value and nationalistic sentiments, however, generally suggests that people with more liberal democratic values tend to be less nationalistic. How should one, then, reconcile and explain this seemingly contradictory relationship in China? Upon further research, the study finds that system support is a confounding factor affecting Chinese urban residents' nationalistic sentiments. People with more nationalistic feelings tend to be those who show less support for the current system in China. Popular political discontent with the Chinese domestic system may very well have a spill-over effect on Chinese people's nationalist feelings toward the outside world."
Why Do States Hedge in East Asia?

In East Asia, hedging takes the form of sending ambiguous alignment signals toward the United States in return for more autonomy by states that have no official alliance with Beijing. Incorporating Lim and Cooper's redefinition of hedging, this study focuses on the conditions under which China's neighbors adopt hedging behaviors. This article aims to show that coercive capability indicators, including national capability and a US military presence, are major factors in decisions by countries in East Asia to adopt hedging strategies. The findings suggest that when countries in this region seek to maximize economic benefits with Beijing, they also seek certain security assurances from Washington as a hedge against Beijing's influence over their national affairs."

The reasons lie first of all in the character of Marxism as truth; in the compatibility of Marxism both with the spirit of Chinese tradition and with conditions at specific times; and with the successful sinicization of Marxism, that reflects the inheriting and developing of Marxism by the Chinese communists. The strategy of proletarian revolution that was formulated by Marx and Engels on the basis of historical developments in Western Europe was of great significance for guiding action in Germany at a time when the bourgeois revolution had been only partially successful, as well as in Russia and China, that were yet to experience a bourgeois revolution as such. This was because the strategy accorded well with the national conditions of these countries. The stance, viewpoints and methodology of Marxism are also compatible in many respects with the traditional Chinese spirit; this has made it possible for the Chinese people to understand and accept Marxism, and helps account for the more successful application of Marxism in the concrete national conditions of China. Together, the establishing of the People's Republic of China and the development of socialism with Chinese characteristics fully demonstrate the truth of Marxism and the inevitability of the victory of socialism over capitalism."

Its perpetuation largely defies established international relations theory which maintains that the lack of a commonly perceived threat leads to alliance dissolution. These U.S. security ties in Asia have instead endured as part of a larger American enterprise to build and promote a liberal postwar order in the face of an existential challenge from the Soviet Union and a growing threat from the People's Republic of China. They have adapted to ongoing forces of regional structural change and are likely to continue doing so, even during Donald Trump's transactional presidency marked by an ""America First"" posture. A combination of geopolitical, economic, and institutional factors will preclude the San Francisco System's demise. That network in unlikely to become an ""Asian NATO."" Washington's management of its Indo‐Pacific alliances and partnerships, however, will become more complex and multifaceted in the years ahead, especially as Chinese regional power and influence grows. More fluid and diverse forms of network management such as selective minilateralism and the integration of threat response policy with order‐building strategy will underscore future U.S. alliance behavior in the region."
Why Joint Development Agreements Fail: Implications for the South China Sea Dispute.,"Xue, Song",Contemporary Southeast Asia: A Journal of International & Strategic Affairs,ISEAS- Yusof Ishak Institute,TREATIES; COMMERCIALIZATION; COMPARATIVE studies; SOUTH China Sea; MARITIME boundaries,disputed waters; energy security; joint development; qualitative comparative analysis; South China Sea,"Although nearly twenty joint development agreements have been signed since the 1950s, only a few have been implemented and even fewer have achieved successful commercialization. This article discusses the conditions leading to the implementation failures of joint development agreements. Applying the Crisp-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis method to nineteen joint development agreements between 1958 and 2008, this article argues that the only causally-related condition associated with the failed implementation of joint development agreements is the deterioration of bilateral relations, often arising from the maritime boundary dispute that the joint development agreement was supposed to resolve. Other possible hypotheses, such as lack of economic incentives, energy independence, domestic opposition, third-party intervention and disagreements over the details of the project, do not show any correlated pattern with the failure to implement such agreements. The finding provides policy implications for the current boundary disputes in the South China Sea: improved bilateral relations is the prerequisite for the effective implementation of joint development ventures, and not the other way around. Littoral states should also not pursue joint development agreements as a false pretext to secretly consolidate their maritime boundary claims, or to confirm the status of a ""dispute"". Furthermore, successful negotiations for a Code of Conduct for the South China Sea may help to create a conducive atmosphere for claimant states to agree on the joint development of offshore hydrocarbon resources.

China's stubborn economic and military rise over the past three decades and also its regional and global behavior arises inquiries related to what sort of emerging power China is? Does China play the role of supporter of the existing order, or, put it simply, it just wants to overthrow it? On the other hand, to what extent China is a free rider of today's global politics? Indeed, China backs the free markets rules, while it disagrees Western institutions or other legal norms. China's free rider approach is closely tied to its ineffective involvement in today's liberal (economic) order considering the economic gifts it has offered to China, so far. Given the United States of America's offshore retrenchment and China's unwillingness to take on the global responsibilities, how strong the current international is? and how it will look like without an orderer? Without any doubt, China is looking for regaining the prestige it had during its past dynasties, but it seems has no interest to take on the global responsibilities. Prestige is the most valuable asset when come to deal in international affairs. Considering those mentioned so far, we are going to assess, using the hegemonic stability theory, wheater China is committed to conserving the US-led international order, or it is ready to topple it. The article, also, will be divided into four parts, as follow- the first part concerns the introduction in the subject, the second part regards the exposure of the hegemonic stability theory. On the other hand, the third part is concerned with how China views the liberal order, while the fourth part is dedicated to the study case- 'Why should China keep the liberal order'?."

This study tests its cross‐national applicability. Cross‐sectional 2012–2013 Health and Retirement Study data from China, England, Mexico, and the United States were analyzed. Heterosexual couples (age ≥60) who were married or partnered were studied (N = 20,565 pairs). Dyadic data were analyzed by multilevel models to examine the effect of self and spousal social and physical health statuses on depressive symptoms. Regression models were used to test the relationship between couples' shared resources and depressive symptom concordance. Results indicated both husbands and wives' depressive symptoms were associated with their own and spouses' social and health statuses. Most couple‐level resources were insignificant predictors for Chinese and Mexican couples' concordance, but having more social and financial resources was associated with higher concordance among British and American couples. Self‐reported health was the most consistent predictor in all countries. The shared resource hypothesis was more applicable to depressive symptom concordance within couples in the United States and England, but not in China and Mexico. Couple‐centered intervention is suggested for clinical practice, and the spousal effect should be considered in policymaking."
Why US-Sino strategic competition is good for Australia.,"Schreer, Benjamin",Australian Journal of International Affairs,Taylor & Francis Ltd,"ECONOMIC competition; MILITARY policy; BIPARTISANSHIP; CHINA-United States relations; TRUMP, Donald, 1946-",Australian security and defence policy; Trump administration; US-Sino relations,"Faced with an increasingly authoritarian and assertive China, the United States (US) under President Trump administration's has embarked on a course toward a more openly competitive US–China relationship. However, the debate in Australia has viewed the new era of US-Sino strategic competition mostly negatively. Indeed, arguments have been made for a need to 'radically' rethink Australia's defence policy in order to prepare for a 'post-US-led' regional order. For some analysts, Canberra has even no other choice than to adopt a strategy of 'armed neutrality' to deal with an emerging China-dominated regional order and a declining US, confused and unwilling to defend its allies. In contrast, this article argues that on balance Trump's course correction on China is positive for Australia as the US is likely to maintain its robust engagement in the Indo-Pacific. While the president's inconsistencies partly undermine US declaratory statements in regards to greater competition with China, a bipartisan consensus is likely to continue to shift US policy in this direction. While greater US-Sino competition requires Australia to assume greater responsibilities for regional security, radical changes to its defence policy and security alignment are not needed."

The framework emphasises the need to focus appraisal on the ultimate benefits that households along a corridor and, more generally, society, can attain—such as increased consumption, better jobs and greater equity. It also emphasises the need to identify and manage trade-offs. The appraisal framework is applied to Pakistan's portion of the CPEC. Simulations suggest important heterogeneous impacts of CPEC among districts in Pakistan stemming from variations in restrictions on land use and in secondary education across connected districts."

Understanding correctly the profound meanings of the strategic moves taken in by the American foreign policy is a challenge for any analyst, considering the fact that we are witnessing an ever-changing political order, in which the great global actors reset their foreign policies surprisingly quickly and thoroughly, distancing themselves from their foreign policy, as we know it. We note that there is a tendency for the great actors on the geopolitical stage of the 21st century to reverse roles, with the USA tempted to embrace the doctrine of protectionism, seen as a doctrine of withdrawal from globalism, while other actors (China) make an effort to live up to the expectations, i.e. to be the new global actors of the 21st century and to support an Asian globalization (no matter the costs). One interesting aspect is that the 'Pacific Century' phrase, credited by the USA under the Obama administration, is not considered outdated by other actors (China, India, Russia etc.) interested in playing a role in the Asia-Pacific key-region, especially with the USA withdrawing from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). The purpose of the present paper is to start from the reality of the USA withdrawing from the TPP and briefly analyse the consequences of this gesture, the possible American alternatives, as well as the role of the regional challengers in the development of alternate projects for this region.

Will Russia's Pivot to Asia Last?,"Miller, Chris",Orbis,Elsevier B.V.,ECONOMIC impact; RUSSIA; HISTORY of the Soviet Union,,"Will the Russian Federation's current ""turn to the East"" have lasting significance? After the annexation of Crimea and the escalated confrontation with the West, Vladimir Putin's government declared it was turning to the East by cultivating ties both with the People's Republic of China and other governments. Russia has ""turned to the East"" repeatedly throughout its history, from the tsarist era to the present day. In the past, geopolitical and economic factors have hindered Russia's Asian Pivots and caused the Kremlin to turn back toward Europe."

Chongqing then emerged as a nerve center of information and opinion. Writers everywhere worked under wartime conditions of social dislocation, economic dependency, and political control. This article examines the writing and publishing of three notable pieces of work completed in wartime Chongqing, Shanghai, and southern Zhejiang, respectively. The article explores the context in which each work was written and then evaluates the broader significance of the texts with regard to a historical assessment of the Chinese intellectual experience during wartime."

Xi's November visits to the Philippines, Brunei, and Papua New Guinea (PNG), including the annual APEC Leaders' Meeting in Port Moresby, and Li's November visit to Singapore and participation in the East Asia Summit, ASEAN Plus Three, and China-ASEAN meetings there showed significant gains. Notably, ASEAN was pliant to Chinese preferences on South China Sea disputes and Beijing showed prominence as a rising power among the Pacific Island nations."

Xi Jinping's 'Major Country Diplomacy:' A Paradigm Shift?,"Wang, Jianwei",Journal of Contemporary China,Taylor & Francis Ltd,"DIPLOMACY; INTERNATIONAL relations; REVOLUTIONS; LEADERSHIP; NATIONAL security; XI, Jinping, 1953-",,"China's diplomacy has undergone a sea of changes under Xi Jinping's rein. But there is no consensus on the nature, scope, essence and direction of these changes. This article aims to explore both the changes and continuities in Chinese foreign affairs under the Xi Jinping leadership through the lens of his recently much-advocated formulation of 'major country diplomacy with distinctive Chinese features'. Tracing the evolution, manifestation and causes of Xi's 'major country diplomacy', it is argued that Xi's diplomacy is a clear departure from Deng Xiaoping's TGYH ([Tao Guang Yang Hui] low profile) strategy and therefore transformative in nature. On the other hand, however, his strong adherence to the core realist assumptions about national security issues makes his idealistic and liberal global vision and his efforts to transcend 'the traditional Western theories of international relations' more difficult to accomplish. In this respect, the glass is still half full and half empty."
Xi Jinping's 'Major Country Diplomacy': The Impacts of China's Growing Capacity.,"Lin, Zhimin",Journal of Contemporary China,Taylor & Francis Ltd,"DIPLOMACY; INTERNATIONAL relations; LEADERSHIP; NATIONALISTS; CHINA -- Foreign relations; XI, Jinping, 1953-",,"In five years, Xi Jinping transformed both domestic and external policies of China to become the only leader after Deng Xiaoping to radically alter internal political landscape and external relations during his first term in office. Chinese leaders from Mao down tended to render foreign policy to a role of a second fiddle in their overall scheme of governing. Xi, however, for reasons that will be explored in this article, has shown determination and confidence to recast this traditional delineation in favor of a more integrated approach. In doing so, Xi has managed to pursue a far more assertive diplomacy. To help understand how Xi managed to carry out his brand of ""major country diplomacy"" (大國外交), the article uses a modified model based on Joel Migdal's state capacity theory. Through a largely populist and nationalist ideology wrapped in globalist rhetoric, institutional revamp and innovation, mobilization of resources, implementation with discipline, risk-taking but skillful leadership while taking advantage of ""world historical timing,"" Xi was able to build a much stronger diplomatic capacity. However, Xi's ""major country diplomacy"" is not without problems and challenges. The prospect of China becoming a true global power is far from certain."
Xi Jinping's 'Major Country Diplomacy': The Role of Leadership in Foreign Policy Transformation.,"Hu, Weixing",Journal of Contemporary China,Taylor & Francis Ltd,"INTERNATIONAL relations; DIPLOMACY; LEADERSHIP; NATIONAL security; CHINA -- Foreign relations; XI, Jinping, 1953-",,"Chinese foreign policy and the conduct of China's diplomacy have undergone tremendous transformation under Xi Jinping's leadership since 2012. How can scholars explain the foreign policy transformation under Xi Jinping? As Chinese power rises fast, do the new power status and the changing balance of power lead to the foreign policy change, or does the more confident leadership play the 'game changer' role? The author argues that international structural changes alone cannot explain the foreign policy shift, and Xi Jinping's leadership has played a key role in transforming Chinese foreign policy since 2012, elevating it to a new height of 'major country diplomacy with Chinese characteristics,' a brand name for the transformed Chinese foreign policy. Xi's leadership role not only affects the redefinition of the vision and mission of Chinese diplomacy, but also leads to institutional restructuring of Chinese foreign and security policy apparatus."

Xiism as a hegemonic project in the making: Sino-communist ideology and the political economy of China's rise.,"Mulvad, Andreas Møller",Review of International Studies,Cambridge University Press,"UNIVERSALISM (Political science); POLITICAL doctrines; POLITICAL stability; POLITICAL leadership; XI, Jinping, 1953-",Bob Jessop; China's Rise; Gramsci; Hegemony; Ideology; International Political Economy,"How is Xi Jinping changing the course of China's rise? Based on a Gramscian analytical framework inspired by Bob Jessop, this article provides an anatomy of Xiism (2012–) as an emergent hegemonic project, that is, a (fallible and contested) attempt by China's party-based power bloc of altering global power balances in China's favour while retaining domestic stability. Through juxtaposition with Maoism (1957–76) and Dengism (1978–2012), it is proposed that Xiism reformulates the power bloc's strategy in three respects. First, the ideological vision of the 'Chinese Dream' negates Mao's utopian-egalitarian universalism while readjusting Deng's pro-market approach by emphasising 'common prosperity'. Second, the economic accumulation strategy – built around the hyped Belt and Road Initiative – aims to reshape global trade and production patterns in a way that particularly benefits the state-owned sector, the Party leadership's economic base. Third, Xi's state project seeks to amalgamate Mao-style charismatic leadership and intra-party 'self-rectification' campaigns with both a Dengist commitment to political stability and traditional Chinese statecraft. The crucial issue for the coming decade is whether the Xi leadership will prove able to paper over the contradictions of this emergent 'China Model' and win support for it both at home and abroad."
XINJIANG DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY AND SOCIO-ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OF ITS BORDER AREAS.,"MADIYEV, Daniyar; MUKHAMETKHANULY, Nabidzhan; ZHANYMKHAN, Oshan; ARDAK, Kaliolla",Central Asia & the Caucasus (14046091),CA & CC Press AB,SOCIOECONOMICS; SOCIAL change; CHINESE Communist Party,border regions; infrastructure; socio-economic development; transborder trade between China and Kazakhstan; Xinjiang development,"In 1949, the Communist Party of China formulated and launched the strategy of political, economic and social changes for the Xinjiang Autonomous Region as part of the People's Republic of China. Since that time the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region has completely depended on the CPC's policy in China and its strategy in the region. Throughout the 1950s-1970s, its traditional social structure underwent certain changes to adjust to the planned socialist economy. In the 1980s-1990s, when China moved away from planned to market economy, the social and economic situation in the region improved considerably. In the first decades of the 21st century, it acquired a new lease on life in the form of the Great Western Development Strategy carried out by the CPC. It embraced 19 cities and provinces across the country and radically changed the situation in Xinjiang for the better, partly owing to financial, technical and human assistance extended by developed cities and provinces on a permanent basis. These concerted efforts improved the region's social and economic context. Today, infrastructure, communication and transportation systems are developing on a high-tech basis. The social and economic situation in the region's border areas, especially in those bordering on Kazakhstan, has been considerably improved. Trade and economic ties are developing with the Central Asian countries, Russia and the West. The development of the cities in the border regions (i.e., Khorgos) and creation of free trade hubs play an important role in China's trade and economic communications and the safety of its borders. In fact, Kazakhstan can learn a lot from China's experience of realizing its strategy of intensified development of Xinjiang's border area to use it in its own border regions."
