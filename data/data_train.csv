‘Bereft of Friends’? China's Rise and Search for Political Partners in South America.,"Strüver, Georg",Chinese Journal of International Politics,14-Mar,Oxford University Press / USA,POWER (Social sciences); WORLD politics; INTERNATIONAL relations; CHINA -- Foreign economic relations; CHINA -- Politics & government,,"Within the scholarly debate on the current power transition in the international system, particular importance is attached to China’s economic rise and the global shifts it is bringing forth in material primacy. A thorough understanding of these shifts in the relative distribution of power, however, requires leaving the narrow path of material capabilities and looking at normative accounts as well. Taking up this challenge, the article focuses on the political dimension of China’s rise by exploring the country’s alignment with South American governments along two dimensions: the convergence of their foreign policy ideas and the provision of diplomatic links facilitating their cooperation and coordination in global politics. The empirical analysis depicts a nascent global agenda forming between China and certain South American countries and shows that, along with growing levels of foreign policy compatibility, China has also advanced its diplomatic inroads into the region, particularly at the level of bilateral relations. Taking these developments as a whole, it is suggested that China has gained international attraction in terms of its visions of global order and as a potential political partner throughout the region. The article concludes with a discussion of the findings in light of the ongoing relative shifts in the distribution of global power beyond material primacy, and the prospects for China’s further political rise.

‘China in Africa’: From Under-researched to Under-theorised?,"A’Zami, Darius",Millennium (03058298),15-Jan,"Sage Publications, Ltd.",INTERNATIONAL relations; POLITICAL science -- Research; AFRICA-China relations; RESEARCH; EQUALITY research; CHINA -- Politics & government,China in Africa; China–Africa relations; international theory; unequal equals,"The literature on China–Africa relations is a rapidly developing field. However, whilst it is a much richer body of work now than it was a few years ago, it has been somewhat resistant to compelling theorisation. This claim is demonstrated via discussion of three recent contributions to this literature. The discussion develops a claim that a helpful problématique might be found by framing China–Africa relations as relations between ‘unequal equals’, a particular benefit of which is that it emphasises that China–Africa relations are, inter alia specifically international relations. Whilst rigorous theoretical work has already been done, the emphasis has been societal. In this sense, the unequal equals formulation amounts to a call for greater dialogue between social and internationally oriented disciplines to resolve the under-theorisation that afflicts the study of China–Africa relations.

‘China Threat’ and ‘China Opportunity’: Politics of Dreams and Fears in China-Central and Eastern European Relations § .,"Pavlićević, Dragan",Journal of Contemporary China,18-Sep,Taylor & Francis Ltd,"POLITICAL science; COLD War, 1945-1991; INTERNATIONAL relations; ECONOMIC development; CHINA; CHINA-European Union relations; TWENTY-first century",,"Development of ‘16 + 1’ framework substantially depends on how Central and Eastern European countries understand their fast-evolving relationship with China. This article investigates and analyses related perceptions and discusses their implications for ‘16 + 1’. Focusing on the Sino-Serbian relationship, the study reveals that the understanding of China and its growing involvement in the region oscillates between the extremes, yet that both positive and negative evaluations are not supported by the available empirical evidence and informed by a proper understanding of the context within which the relationship takes place. This is likely to result in a sense of disillusionment, as well as heightened concerns about the relationship with China, casting shadow over the prospects of the China-CEE relations.

In this article I analyse how and to what extent the (re)entry on the development scene of China, India and Brazil, together with increasing prices for primary commodities and improved access to international finance, has affected Zambia’s political leverage to set, implement and fund its own developmental policies. I argue that, while real changes in external financial flows comparable to aid from these non-traditional state actors are still small, these actors’ experience is providing Zambia with an alternative development model that combines purposive state intervention with market-based economic growth and integration into world markets. While Zambia may be taking the first steps in strengthening its ‘sovereign frontier’, the extent of this movement is still small and its development outcomes are far from assured.

"‘New friends, easier partners and bigger brothers’: The influence of the emerging powers on agriculture and food security in Malawi.","De Bruyn, Tom",South African Journal of International Affairs,16-Mar,Taylor & Francis Ltd,INTERNATIONAL relations; INTERNATIONAL cooperation; FOOD security; MALAWI -- Foreign relations -- 1964-; MALAWI -- Politics & government -- 1994-,"agricultural assistance; Brazil, India, PR China, South Africa; emerging powers; Malawi; South–south cooperation","Emerging powers are credited with influencing development cooperation, but field-based studies incorporating the viewpoints of recipient developing country actors are scarce. This article analyses the presence and the material, ideational and institutional influence of assistance in agriculture and food security in Malawi by the governments of Brazil, India, China and South Africa. The findings suggest first that, despite a similar and powerful discourse linking these four states, in practice the emerging powers' approaches diverge to a large extent. Second, the material influence of these emerging powers is relatively limited and consequently so is their influence on Malawi's decision-making process with regard to development. Finally, perceptions about the emerging powers' potential contribution to addressing development challenges differ greatly between the Malawian government and the traditional donor community. This difference arises from limited coordination and cooperation on the one hand and the importance of ideational influence on the other.

‘Power Shift’ in East Asia? A Critical Reappraisal of Narratives on the Diaoyu/Senkaku Islands Incident in 2010†.,"Hagström, Linus",Chinese Journal of International Politics,12-Sep,Oxford University Press / USA,INTERNATIONAL relations; POLICY sciences; SOVEREIGNTY; SENKAKU Islands; CHINA; JAPAN; EAST Asia; CONSTRUCTIVISM (Philosophy),,"The article focuses on the power shift narrative in Sino-Japanese interaction regarding the Diaoyu/Senkaku Islands in 2010. It states that the notion showing the rising of China, the declining of Japan, and the power shift in East Asia is compatible with the epistemological core of constructivism. It also discusses bilateral relationship between China and Japan, Japanese policymaking, and sovereign competition on two parties."
‘Threatening’ China and US security: the international politics of identity.,"TURNER, OLIVER",Review of International Studies,13-Oct,Cambridge University Press,"NATIONAL security; THREATS; INTERNATIONAL relations; WORLD politics; COLD War, 1945-1991; HISTORY; UNITED States; IDENTITY (Philosophical concept); CHINA-United States relations",,"China's increasing capabilities are a central focus of modern day US security concerns. The International Relations literature is a key forum for analyses of the so-called ‘China threat’ and yet it remains relatively quiet on the role of ideas in the construction and perpetuation of the dangers that country is understood to present. This article reveals that throughout history ‘threats’ from China towards the United States, rather than objectively verifiable phenomena, have always been social constructions of American design and thus more than calculations of material forces. Specifically, it argues that powerful and pervasive American representations of China have been repeatedly and purposefully responsible for creating a threatening identity. It also demonstrates that these representations have enabled and justified US China policies which themselves have reaffirmed the identities of both China and the United States, protecting the latter when seemingly threatened by the former. Three case studies from across the full duration of Sino-American relations expose the centrality of ideas to historical and contemporary understandings of China ‘threats’, and to the American foreign policies formulated in response.

30 Years After Tiananmen: Dissent Is Not Dead.,"Economy, Elizabeth",Journal of Democracy,19-Apr,Johns Hopkins University Press,HUMAN rights; INTERNATIONAL relations; CHINESE Communist Party,,"In developments that form a stark contrast to the hopes that accompanied the Tiananmen Square demonstrations of thirty years ago, Xi Jinping's Chinese Communist Party regime has devised new ways to consolidate power and crackdown on dissent. Yet despite an ever-expanding surveillance apparatus and a burgeoning social-credit system, the political values and spirit of collective action embodied in the 1989 democracy movement have endured and even thrived. Indeed, while the Xi government may appear all-powerful, political fissures are widening, and there are many pockets of discontent. China may not appear to be moving on the right track-but we have not yet reached the end of Chinese history.

A call for a new Japanese foreign policy: the dilemmas of a stakeholder state.,"INOGUCHI, TAKASHI",International Affairs,14-Jul,Oxford University Press / USA,INTERNATIONAL relations; POWER (Social sciences); POLITICAL realism; PRAGMATISM; BALANCE of power; GLOBALIZATION; UNITED Nations; CHINA -- Foreign relations -- 21st century; JAPAN -- Foreign relations -- 1989-; JAPAN -- Politics & government -- 1989-; EAST Asia -- Politics & government -- 1945-; FOREIGN relations of the United States -- 21st century,,"Japanese foreign policy is at a crossroads. A global power transition is under way; while the United States remains the leading global power, across the globe non-western developing states are on the rise. Within Asia, China is a growing presence, wielding expansive claims on islands and maritime rights, and embarking on a defence buildup. As power shifts across Asia and the wider world, the terms of leadership and global governance have become more uncertain. Japan now finds itself asking basic questions about its own identity and strategic goals as a Great Power. Within this changing context, there are three foreign policy approaches available to Japan: (1) a classical realist line of working closely with the US in meeting China's rise and optimizing deep US engagement with China by pursuing a diplomacy focused on counterbalancing and hedging; (2) a transformative pragmatist line of rejuvenating itself through Abenomics and repositioning itself in East Asia; and (3) a liberal international line of pursuing a common agenda of enhancing global liberal-oriented norms and rules through multilateral institutions along with the United States and the Asia-Pacific countries. Current Japanese foreign policy contains a mix of all three approaches. The article argues that a greater focus on the second and the third lines would enhance the current approach; it would ensure that Japan is more in harmony with the global environment and help it work positively for global and regional stability and prosperity, thus enabling Japan to pursue an 'honorable place in the world' (as stated in the preamble to its constitution).

"A dangerous synergy: energy securitization, great power rivalry and strategic stability in the Asian century.","Phillips, Andrew",Pacific Review,13-Mar,Taylor & Francis Ltd,ENERGY consumption; ENERGY security; INTERNATIONAL economic relations; GREAT powers (International relations); ENERGY policy; INTERNATIONAL cooperation; ASIA; JAPAN -- Foreign relations; CHINA -- Foreign relations; INDIA -- Foreign relations,Asia-Pacific security; economic security; Energy security; Great Power rivalry; securitization,"This paper analyzes the current and prospective implications of Asia's energy consumption revolution for regional stability. Adopting a comparative and historical approach, I argue that Japanese energy security anxieties worked to reinforce regional alignment patterns in East Asia for nearly two decades following the Shanghai communiqué, thereby strengthening regional stability. Conversely, the post-Cold War period has seen in China and India's rise the emergence of Asian energy super-consumers that are not formally aligned with the United States, but that are increasingly dependent on imported energy supplies to fuel their industrialization. This newfound dependence on energy imports has seen both countries follow Japan's longstanding example in securitizing energy as a policy issue. In the context of an already more contested Asia, this trend towards energy securitization has aggravated regional tensions and will continue to do so unless greater efforts are undertaken bilaterally, regionally and globally to foster more effective forms of energy cooperation.

A GAME CHANGER: NORTH KOREA'S THIRD NUCLEAR TEST AND NORTHEAST ASIAN SECURITY.,Jinwook Choi,Journal of East Asian Affairs,Spring/Summer2013,Institute for National Security Strategy,"NUCLEAR weapons testing; NUCLEAR weapons; INTERNATIONAL relations; NATIONAL security; CHINA -- Relations; PARK, Geun-hye, 1952-",alliances and partnerships; Kim Jong-un; the Park Geun-hye government; Trust-building Process,"North Korea's provocations after the third nuclear test have affected the Chinese stance towards the regime. China has condoned the North's nuclear weapons because of its preoccupation with the regime's stability. China is concerned that Korean unification triggered by North Korea's instability could lead to a stronger and more robust U.S.-ROK alliance. Ironically, the costs of the Chinese efforts to keep North Korea stable could indeed result in a stronger U.S.-ROK alliance in the short-run. Thus, China is playing a more active role in discouraging North Korea from escalating tensions. Seoul's efforts to open channels of dialogue with North Korea are welcomed by both the U.S. and China. In this sense, a multilateral dialogue process in Northeast Asia should not be put off. A multilateral cooperation in Northeast Asia is a very important part of the Park Geun-hye government's North Korean policy, which believes that inter-Korean relations should be closely aligned with regional security cooperation.

A Good Neighbor of Bad Governance? China's Energy and Mining Development in Southeast Asia.,"Liao, Jessica C.",Journal of Contemporary China,19-Jul,Taylor & Francis Ltd,DIPLOMACY; INTERNATIONAL relations; ENERGY development; BELT & Road Initiative; BUSINESS partnerships,,"The policies of Going Out and Good Neighbor have worked in tandem to direct Chinese diplomacy toward Southeast Asia over the past decades. This article asks how these policies have shaped Chinese energy and mining firms' business decisions in the region. Using a combination of quantitative and qualitative data, this article argues that while Going Out and Good Neighbor have contributed to the growth of China's energy and mining development projects in Southeast Asia, this outcome is not merely the result of a state-directed initiative. The growth is also driven by Chinese state-owned firms that take advantage of Beijing's policy agenda and the institutional shortcomings behind it to plow state-backed resources into business partnerships with weak rule-of-law governments in the region. These partnerships and the associated projects are often touted as an arm of Chinese diplomacy, emboldening these firms to make risky expansion. Moreover, market, diplomatic, social, and geographic factors inherent to Southeast Asia further catalyze Chinese firms' risky business practices while at the same time Beijing, prioritizing diplomatic relations over good governance, has been slow to police problems stemming from its firms' dubious partnerships. In the end, this situation has hurt China's image, contrary to Good Neighbor's intended objectives.

A New Era in Taiwan Politics and its Implications.,"Tan, Andrew T. H.",Asia-Pacific Review,17-May,Taylor & Francis Ltd,PRACTICAL politics; INTERNATIONAL relations; BALANCE of power; DEMOCRATIC Progressive Party (Taiwan); TAIWAN -- Politics & government,,"Taiwan faces an uncertain future after the electoral victory of the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) in the January 2016 elections. The election results, which reflected growing pro-independence sentiments amongst a younger generation of Taiwanese, have set Taiwan on a collision course with China, which is increasingly impatient for reunification to occur. The new US president, Donald Trump, has also added to the tensions by openly questioning the “One China” policy. Another Taiwan Strait crisis today would be fraught with immense risks due to China's dramatic economic and military rise which has altered the regional power balance. Given the increasingly tense China-US strategic rivalry, the US is also not likely to sit idly by should China attack Taiwan. However, the key player in resolving the Taiwan problem is China. For various reasons, it is in fact in China's interest to be patient with the current situation, and maintain the status quo for the immediate and medium-term future, while it constructs a new strategy that could win over the people of Taiwan, since true reunification can only occur if the people on Taiwan willingly accept it.

A new spear in Asia: why is Japan moving toward autonomous defense?,"Fatton, Lionel P",International Relations of the Asia-Pacific,19-May,Oxford University Press / USA,NATIONAL security; POLITICAL autonomy; INTERNATIONAL security; INTERNATIONAL relations; JAPAN-United States relations; JAPAN -- Foreign relations -- 1989-; JAPAN,,"Japan is on the verge of what would be a dramatic shift in defense posture. The 'spear and shield' structure of the US–Japan alliance, at the center of its security policy for most of the postwar era, is being revamped by a move toward autonomous defense. Why would a country confined to a largely passive and Americanocentrist posture for more than half a century suddenly change course? I argue that autonomy is for Japan the only way out of an unprecedented 'entrapment-abandonment dilemma': any attempt to prevent defection by the United States in the face of an increasingly assertive China heightens to an unacceptable level the risk of Japan being dragged into a US-led conflict in the Korean Peninsula, and vice versa. Japan's ability to wield the spear would likely have destabilizing consequences for the whole Asia-Pacific region.

A Nonbalancing Act: Explaining Indonesia’s Failure to Balance Against the Chinese Threat.,"Syailendra, Emirza Adi",Asian Security,Sep-Dec2017,Taylor & Francis Ltd,MARITIME law; DEMOCRACY; INTERNATIONAL relations; INDONESIA; CHINA,,"Indonesia faces an increasing maritime threat from China. Incursions of China’s maritime law enforcement forces protecting Chinese ships fishing illegally in Indonesia’s Exclusive Economic Zone pose a threat to President Joko Widodo’s goal of transforming Indonesia into a Global Maritime Fulcrum. China’s actions generate the prediction that Indonesia should balance against China, but this has not occurred. Instead, bureaucratic politics and President Jokowi’s interest in securing Chinese financial support for his ambitious infrastructure projects have prevented the adoption of a more assertive balancing policy. Using Schweller’s argument that threats go unanswered when there is disagreement among key domestic actors, this article argues that a lack of elite consensus in Indonesia is impeding the adoption of a balancing policy. Instead, Indonesia is continuing its traditional policy ofnonbalancing.

A Quasi-adjudicative Dispute Settlement Mechanism for CEPA: The Rule of Law in Trade Relations between Mainland China and Hong Kong.,"Villalta Puig, Gonzalo",Chinese Journal of International Law,13-Jun,Oxford University Press / USA,RULE of law; CONFLICT management; INTERNATIONAL economic integration; INTERNATIONAL relations; HONG Kong (China); CHINA -- Foreign relations,,"This article analyses the exclusion of the rule of law in dispute settlement from trade relations between Mainland China and Hong Kong. Other than a power-based provision to resolve any problems through consultation, the Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement (CEPA) between the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China and the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region does not contain any rules or procedures for the settlement of disputes between the two sides. The politicization of dispute settlement favours the freedom of informality but compromises certainty of implementation, efficiency of consistency, and transparency of justice, all necessary for further and fairer trade creation and economic integration. This article, therefore, calls for the rule of law in trade relations between Mainland China and Hong Kong with a proposal for a quasi-adjudicative dispute settlement mechanism for CEPA that complements the political framework for consultation and negotiation with an adjudicative framework for arbitration and implementation.

In order to uncover what 'responsible power' means in the context of Chinese participation in peacekeeping, this article analyses the motivations and barriers that shape China's peacekeeping deployments. The term 'responsible power' has value not only because it is flexible, capturing China's ambivalence regarding peacekeeping, but also because 'responsible power' enables China to frame the discourse regarding its foreign and security policy. It appears that for the near future, China remains committed to modest engagement in peacekeeping. The article concludes that China has the potential to foster an ever more constructive role in the UN peacekeeping regime. However, in order to effectively engage China, a deeper understanding of the policy priorities of Chinese foreign policy actors is needed.

And the West has always been the developer of the new norms in international society, and changes in international norms reflect the link between power on one hand and norms, rules and institutions on the other. That is a fact or an invented reality which a rapidly rising China has to deal with, and its implications on China's future relationship with the international society are sure to be great and far-reaching.

A sleeping giant awakes? The rise of the Institutional Grammar Tool (IGT) in policy research.,"Dunlop, Claire A.; Kamkhaji, Jonathan C.; Radaelli, Claudio M.",Journal of Chinese Governance,19-Jun,Taylor & Francis Ltd,INTERNATIONAL relations; GOVERNMENT policy; META-analysis; INSTITUTIONAL investors; CORPORATE governance,governance; Institutional Analysis and Development (IAD); Institutional Grammar Tool (IGT); Policy design; theories of the policy process,"The Institutional Grammar Tool (IGT) is an important and relatively recent innovation in policy theory and analysis. It is conceptualized to empirically operationalize the insights of the Institutional Analysis and Development (IAD) framework. In the last decade, political scientists have offered a number of applications of the IGT, mainly focused on disclosing and scrutinizing in-depth the textual configurations of policy documents. These efforts, involving micro-level analyses of syntax as well as more general classifications of institutional statements according to rule types, have underpinned empirical projects mainly in the area of environmental and common-pool resources. Applications of IGT are still in their infancy, yet the growing momentum is sufficient for us to review what has been learned so far. We take stock of this recent, fast-growing literature, analyzing a corpus of 26 empirical articles employing IGTs published between 2008 and 2017. We examine them in terms of their empirical domain, hypotheses, and methods of selection and analysis of institutional statements. We find that the existing empirical applications do not add much to explanation, unless they are supported by research questions and hypotheses grounded in theory. We offer three conclusions. First, to exploit the IGT researchers need to go beyond the descriptive, computational approach that has dominated the field until now. Second, IGT studies grounded in explicit hypotheses have more explanatory leverage, and therefore, should be encouraged when adopting the tool outside the Western world. Third, by focusing on rules, researchers can capture findings that are more explanatory and less microscopic.

Although Colombia has been attracting inward FDI in quantities similar to other key regional states, its macroeconomic and sectoral features and investment attraction policies positively correlate with many of the factors known to attract Chinese outward FDI (OFDI), and both the Colombia and Chinese governments are committed to increasing Chinese OFDI (COFDI) flows to Colombia, COFDI volumes to the Andean nation have yet to live up to expectations. This puzzling case highlights the need for a better understanding of the political-economic factors that drive COFDI. My case study show that Colombia's political and economic traits have been hindering COFDI. Regarding the former, Colombia's local politics regarding extractive activities and bidding on infrastructure projects and its close relations with the United States function to create an adverse environment for increased COFDI. With respect to the latter, the international economic environment, especially regarding commodities' prices, has impaired Chinese investment in Colombia. Overall, Colombia's case underscores the delicate interplay of international, national, and subnational factors on COFDI flows.

Partisan electoral interventions have been frequently used by the great powers ever since the rise of meaningful competitive elections around the world. Such interventions have been found to have significant effects on the results of the intervened elections determining in many cases the identity of the winner. Nevertheless, there has been little research on the effects of partisan electoral interventions on the target's subsequent level of democracy. This study investigates this question, testing three hypotheses derived from relevant political science literatures. I find suggestive evidence that covert electoral interventions have a significant negative effect on the target's democracy increasing its susceptibility to a democratic breakdown. I also find preliminary evidence that the identity of the intervener has a mediating effect on the negative effects of covert interventions.

Australia's response to a rising China.","Manicom, James; O'Neil, Andrew",Pacific Review,10-Mar,Taylor & Francis Ltd,ECONOMIC policy; INTERNATIONAL economic relations; CHINA; AUSTRALIA; CHINA -- Foreign economic relations; AUSTRALIA -- Foreign relations -- 1945-; CHINA -- Foreign relations -- 1976-,Accommodation; engagement; great powers; realignment; secondary powers,"Since normalising diplomatic relations in 1972, successive Australian and Chinese governments have focused on deepening trade and investment links to such an extent that China now looms as one of the most critical countries on Australia's twenty-first century horizon. For their part, Chinese elites have welcomed closer ties with Australia and have been particularly keen to accelerate China's direct investment in the Australian mining and energy sectors. Since the early 2000s, a number of commentators have argued that Australia has been gradually drifting towards China's sphere of influence in the Asia-Pacific. This trend, they argue, has been reinforced following the election in 2007 of the Labor party government, which has terminated Australia's involvement in quadrilateral talks with the US, India, and Japan; stepped back from commitments to export uranium to China's long-standing rival, India; and intensified Australia's public criticism of Japanese whaling practices. Meanwhile, in 2008, Prime Minister Kevin Rudd made a point of paying a high profile visit to China during his first major overseas journey, but not matching it with a visit to Japan. Is Australia drifting towards China's strategic orbit in Asia? The article examines this question through the prism of three key indicators of realignment and concludes that, while there is some evidence of Australia accommodating Chinese strategic preferences in Asia, there is no indication that it is realigning itself strategically towards China and away from its long-standing ally, the US.

According to the author, the issue of climate change in China does not involve a great deal of conflict because of the accepted view among government, business leaders, and many non-governmental organizations (NGOs) that climate commitment depends on the fulfillment of China's economic and social goals. Topics include an in-depth overview of Chinese nationalism and the author's hypothesis on why the dynamics of global politics is creating a political atmosphere in which the Chinese public remains loyal to the state's defense of autonomy when responding to climate change."

Relying upon a large body of primary sources (including 170 interviews), it seeks to contribute to the understanding of this strategically sensitive yet neglected area of Sino-American relations. It is shown that, as a consequence of the erosion of the US capacity to control the diffusion of defense-related technology to China in the post-Cold War era, a growing set of actors within the United States has reassessed the security/economic calculus in Washington's relationship with Beijing. Specifically, this coalition advocates the streamlining of export controls to sustain the defense and technological industrial base and thereby maintain American military/technological preeminence vis-à-vis a rising China.

Afghanistan and China's new neighbourhood diplomacy.,"HUASHENG, ZHAO",International Affairs,16-Jul,Oxford University Press / USA,DIPLOMACY; INTERNATIONAL security; INTERNATIONAL relations; RECONCILIATION; MILITARY personnel; HISTORY; AFGHANISTAN -- Foreign relations; CHINA -- Foreign relations; UNITED States,,"This article investigates the latest developments and changes in China's increasingly active diplomacy towards Afghanistan. This is interpreted from two perspectives. First, focusing on China's domestic perspective the author points out that under the 'one belt, one road' initiative, China's interests in Afghanistan have expanded, particularly in the area of transport; it has started seriously to consider Afghanistan as a transport corridor. The other perspective considers the withdrawal of US military forces and the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) from Afghanistan in 2014, which has been followed by a critical transitional period. Concerned by these developments, China has increased its involvement and taken on more responsibilities, as demonstrated by the unprecedented frequency of Chinese senior officials' visits to Afghanistan; the significant increase of bilateral aid to Afghanistan; and above all, the fact that Beijing has begun to coordinate negotiations between the Taliban and the Afghan government. The process of political reconciliation in the country will be extremely difficult and a quick solution is not to be expected. With regard to the idea that the Chinese are filling a 'vacuum' left by the US, the article argues that the so-called vacuum does not actually exist because the US military presence was temporary and the withdrawal of the US forces represents a return to the normal state of affairs. Also, excluding the US is not part of Beijing's policy in this area; rather, it is cooperating with the US and other countries in assisting Afghanistan.

This paper explores the growing involvement of China in the development and transfer of renewable energy technologies in Africa and examines the key drivers and obstacles shaping Chinese renewable energy investments and exports. Far from there being some kind of grand or harmonious strategy directed by a single monolithic state, we argue that fragmented and decentralised state apparatuses and quasi-market actors in China are increasingly pursuing their own independent interests and agendas around renewable energy in Africa in ways often marked by conflict, inconsistency and incoherence. Moving beyond the state-centric analysis common in much of the research on contemporary China-Africa relations, we examine the motivations of a range of non-state and quasi-state actors, as well their different perceptions and constructions of risk, policy environments and political stability in recipient countries. The paper explores the case study example of South Africa, where Chinese firms have become increasingly significant in the diffusion of renewable energy technology.

Africa and the rising powers: bargaining for the 'marginalized many'.,"VICKERS, BRENDAN",International Affairs,13-May,Oxford University Press / USA,EMERGING markets; ECONOMIC expansion; INTERNATIONAL organization; ECONOMIC development; ECONOMICS; INTERNATIONAL relations; NEGOTIATION; FOREIGN investments; ECONOMIC underdevelopment; INTERNATIONAL cooperation on climate change; BRICS countries; AFRICA; AFRICAN Union; AFRICA -- Foreign relations,,"With abundant resources and growing markets, the African continent is once again at the centre of a new 'great game of courtship' between the established and rising powers. However, compared with previous decades, African countries are no longer passive players in international relations. This article explores Africa's recent negotiating behaviour in relation to a selected set of actors that animate the current shifting global economic order: rising powers, established powers and international organizations. Despite potential sources of bargaining leverage, most African countries (with some notable exceptions) are still reactive to the bilateral overtures of Brazil, China and India and unable to set the terms of engagement. Nonetheless, the rise of these new powers provides alternative negotiating partners (and potentially more developmental outcomes) to the established powers. By comparison, at the multilateral level the African Group has been far more active and assertive in contesting global governance in the pursuit of greater distributive justice, particularly in the climate, trade and security regimes. This has taken place largely through the adroit use of distributive bargaining and tactics, supplemented by normative-based strategies highlighting Africa's underdevelopment. The central argument of the article is that African countries require judicious negotiating strategies, improved deliberative capacities and coalitions with local/continental/global civil society and business networks in order to ameliorate their weaker bargaining power and reshape the terms of their engagement with their international partners, particularly the rising powers.

This paper assesses the ""competitive pressure"" that China's growing presence in Africa exerts on the European development policy regime. Drawing on interviews conducted in China, Ethiopia and Europe between 2008 and 2011, the paper analyses Ethiopia as a case study. Ethiopia has emerged as one of the most important countries in Chinese as well as European cooperation with Africa. Yet, Chinese and European policies toward Ethiopia differ greatly. The EU mainly engages Ethiopia as an aid recipient, whereas China has developed a comprehensive political and economic partnership with the East African state. China has thereby become an alternative partner to the Ethiopian government, a development that both sheds light on the gap between European rhetoric and policy practice and puts pressure on the EU to make more efforts to reform its development policy system.

Ministry of Foreign Affairs; MA, Yingjiu, 1950-",aid; China; cross strait; development; diplomacy; ODA,"Taiwan's foreign aid policy is largely a response to its China-imposed international isolation. Taiwan provides aid without stringent accountability conditions to countries in Africa, the Americas, and the South Pacific in order to maintain official diplomatic relations in the face of Chinese opposition. Often at odds with this is Taiwan's interest in seeking western support through being seen as a responsible aid donor. Domestic political constraints on Taiwan's aid budget accentuate the tension between these two interests. Taiwan's aid program can be seen as the product of these three competing and enduring pressures – maintaining the count of official diplomatic relationships, improving its international reputation, and containing aid spending. Taiwan President Ma Ying-jeou's tacit ‘diplomatic truce’ with China – part of a wider warming of intergovernmental relations across the Taiwan Strait – has reduced significantly the squeeze between these three pressures on Taiwan's foreign aid policy. It has allowed the Ma administration to improve Taiwan's reputation, while maintaining or even reducing its aid expenditure, and still retain the same number of official diplomatic relationships. Nevertheless, the Ma administration has not wanted to alienate recipient governments while the prospects for the diplomatic truce with China remain uncertain. There remains considerable continuity with past practices, and the government's handling of aid as a foreign policy tool is still largely opaque and unaccountable.

It is a situation generated by the collapse of the Eastern European communist bloc and the USSR in the late 80s and early 90s, or the resistance impact to the New World Order fueled by the negative phenomena of globalization. One of the concerns of any policymakers is to know well the power relations at global and regional levels, as from their substance they will know which are the margins of action, towards one direction or another. Therefore, it will always seek to find out who is stronger and who could take domination on the scenes of international politics. Therefore, we will briefly review the factors that make the countries Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa unable to defeat the global dominance of the US and its major allies, only to budge it a little. Vladimir Putin has created two organizations competing to G7 and NATO. Two summits were held in Ufa, Russian Federation: the Summit of the Organization of Shanghai Cooperation (comprised of Russia, China, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan) and the group BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa). At the summit the organization was invited Belarus president, Alexander Lukashenko, as the leader of a country member in the Eurasian Economic Union countries. The Kremlin is trying to play the leading role in these organizations, but according to the International experts, such attempts did not succeed because Moscow cannot go beyond the shadow of Beijing's de facto leader of both structures.

American Missionary Universities in China and the Middle East and American Philanthropy: Interacting Soft Power of Transnational Actors.,"Bertelsen, Rasmus Gjedssø",Global Society: Journal of Interdisciplinary International Relations,14-Jan,Taylor & Francis Ltd,ENDOWMENT of research; BICULTURALISM; INTERNATIONAL economic relations; AMERICAN Missionary Association; FOREIGN relations of the United States; CHINA-United States relations; MIDDLE East-United States relations,,"This article investigates the interacting soft power of two important categories of American transnational actors: American missionary universities in China and the Middle East and American religious, foundation and individual philanthropy. These transnational actors have had and have soft power in Chinese and Middle East societies based on academic excellence and biculturalism. However, this transnational actor soft power has historically been limited by religious proselytising, unequal treaties between China and the West, the humiliation of China, and American China and Middle East policy. The universities have had and continue to have reverse soft power in the USA attracting resources and advocating on behalf of China and the Middle East. Philanthropic support for the educational, research, healthcare and social development work of these universities has contributed to university soft power in the host societies. The universities and their philanthropic donors have strengthened US national soft power regarding milieu goals of elite attraction to education, language and liberal norms. However, US national soft power concerning possession goals of acceptance of foreign policies in China and the Middle East has not been strengthened, and was also not a university, philanthropic or government goal.

Americans and the Rise of China as a World Power.,"Xie, Tao; Page, Benjamin I.",Journal of Contemporary China,10-Jun,Taylor & Francis Ltd,INTERNATIONAL relations; GREAT powers (International relations); PUBLIC opinion; POWER (Social sciences); POLITICAL attitudes; NATIONAL security; ECONOMIC security; NEOLIBERALISM; CHINA; UNITED States; TAIWAN; JAPAN,,"The rapid ascendency of China has attracted considerable attention from American scholars, policymakers, and media. Yet what does the American public think about the rise of China as a world power? In this paper we use survey data collected by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs and other organizations to explore the nature and causes of Americans' views. It turns out that most Americans are well aware of the rise of China. Some are apprehensive about that rise, chiefly for national security (rather than economic) reasons, and many favor a degree of off-shore 'balancing' of the sort that realists recommend. But few Americans want to actively work to limit the rise of China. Very few favor the use of troops to defend Taiwan. Very few favor a nuclear-armed Japan. Large majorities of Americans take stands more akin to those of neo-liberals than realist theorists, favoring cooperation and peaceful engagement with China.

The article analyzes governments' priorities for the terms and conditions of development finance flows they would like to access. The analysis finds that (1) Chinese official finance is the largest component of external development finance flows beyond official development assistance ( ODA) in the countries analyzed, far larger than global figures would suggest, (2) partner countries welcome more choice and more finance, (3) countries identify ownership, alignment with national priorities, speed of project delivery, portfolio diversification as key priorities, and (4) the rise of providers such as China has increased the potential bargaining power of recipient countries vis-à-vis more traditional donors.

"An Emerging China and Diasporic Chinese: historicity, state, and international relations.","Liu, Hong",Journal of Contemporary China,11-Nov,Taylor & Francis Ltd,CHINESE diaspora; INTERNATIONAL relations; DIASPORA; DEMOCRACY; POLITICAL science; DIPLOMACY; CHINA; OVERSEAS Chinese; CHINA -- Politics & government -- 1949-,,"The past decade has seen a growing body of literature on the (re)emergence of China and its implications for the new international order, and this scholarship is accompanied by the attempts from both within and outside of China to establish Chinese schools of international relations (IR). These admirable efforts, however, have been largely state-centric and concerned mainly with the balance of power, with little attention being directed to the diaspora's role in the evolution of China's international relationship and their potential contribution to bridging China studies and international relations theorization. Drawing upon theoretical insights from both IR and diaspora studies and employing a wide range of primary data including archives and personal interviews, this essay examines the diaspora's role (or the lack of it) in China's diplomacy since 1949 and attempts to conceptualize the Chinese experience in an historical and comparative perspective. I argue that historicity and state have played a significant part in shaping the interactions between the diaspora and diplomacy. The Chinese state's resilient capacity in domesticating (potential) diplomatic problems with respect to the diaspora and transforming them into new policy initiatives through facilitating diasporic participation in China's socio-economic and political processes has opened up new venues for the Chinese overseas to be involved in China's diplomacy. This article concludes by considering three different routes in engaging the diaspora with diplomacy at a time of China rising and by calling for strategic integration of diaspora into the emerging discourses on 'IR theories with Chinese characteristics'.

An Enigma that is South Asia: India versus the Region.,"Ghosh, ParthaS.",Asia-Pacific Review,13-May,Taylor & Francis Ltd,INTERNATIONAL economic relations; STRATEGIC planning; SOCIAL networks; INTERNATIONAL relations; SOUTH Asian Association for Regional Cooperation; SOUTH Asia -- Politics & government,,"The South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) is now 28 years old, yet its success is nominal. That more important bilateral issues are discussed on the sidelines of SAARC Summits proves the point. Intra-regional trade is still miniscule compared to the region's overall share in the world trade. The biggest defaulter is India, the most prominent member of the group. The purpose of this paper is first to raise the question whether South Asia qualifies to be called a region, and second to argue that, given the problems it faces with most of its neighbours, India is forced to conclude that SAARC matters the least for it. For economic and strategic reasons, India's interests lie in global networking and in a balanced relationship with China. Since Chinese military, diplomatic, and economic presence in South Asia poaches into India's perceived sphere of influence, India's interest in SAARC is limited to that context for otherwise it neither provides large markets for India nor does it contribute to India's strategic policy. Inversely, such a situation justifies India's neighbours playing the China card to bargain with India though that card its losing its value. To buttress our arguments we have drawn from the region's historical experiences as well as from recent developments in international and South Asian politics, including domestic politics.

The recent predominance of the military in Thailand's domestic politics has clashed with Washington's interpretation of the Shinawatra family's prior ascent to power through electoral processes. China's rise and its efforts to court the current Thai government by staying out of Thailand's internal politics has further exacerbated tensions with American policymakers who had already reduced the scope and depth of ties with Bangkok. How Thailand's political polarization is resolved will be most consequential to the future of Thai-U.S. security relations. However, continued U.S. alliance relations remain essential for Thailand in view of China's intense campaign to woo Thailand's coup leaderships in 2006 and 2014. A lopsided Thai-Chinese relationship puts at risk Thailand's traditionally masterful and clever foreign policy pragmatism and undercuts the traditional benefits that both the United States and Thailand have derived from their longstanding alliance relationship.

It is stated that the aim of international relations scholarship is to understand various ways in which states achieve their aims."

Three economic liberal hypotheses are tested using data from the International Cooperation and Regional Conflicts dataset to measure dyadic political interaction along with economic data from the IMF and China Statistical Yearbooks and control variable data from Polity IV, COW CINC, among other sources. Though a significant amount of literature addresses the effects trade has on conflict at the systemic level, few studies address it at the dyadic level and even fewer test the pacification of trade on non-Western states. Examining economic, political, institutional, geographical, and political relations data from 1987 to 2001, this research tests the economic liberal hypothesis which posits that interdependence is associated with cooperative political relations between states. The findings show that trade interdependence is generally associated with political cooperation. However, the realist contention that relative power increases are associated with political conflict is also supported and analysed further.

Analysing Regionalism within International Law and Relations: The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation as a Grossraum?,"Salter, Michael; Yin, Yinan",Chinese Journal of International Law,14-Dec,Oxford University Press / USA,REGIONALISM; INTERNATIONAL law; INTERNATIONAL relations; POLITICAL science; INTERNATIONAL cooperation; SHANGHAI Cooperation Organisation,,"This article argues for a new way of addressing contemporary international law that is more adequate to both vital dynamic trends towards “regionalism” within international law, relations and politics, and the emergent possibility of a far more pluralistic “multipolar” legal order that—in both theory and practice—contrasts markedly with US-dominated hegemonic modes of regulation and high-handed unilateralism. To advance our argument, we draws upon classic Schmittian forms of Grossraum theory concerned to adapt traditional state-centric and purely horizontal conceptual types of international law interpretations to a form of international relations structured around regional ensembles, such as the European Union, NATO, the African Union, and the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO). These historical trends are emerging out of an encompassing contemporary developmental tendency, including the decline in the traditional nation state posited as having equal status, and both the proliferation of new regional bodies and the strengthening of existing ones. Arguably, the emergence of the SCO from 2001 signals a new phase in multilateralism in the post-Cold War period that, when treated as a case study, allows us to “test out” the credibility of key aspects of Grossraum theory.

However, a preliminary analysis of the rising China's foreign policy behavior doesn't uphold such conventional wisdom. Through the case study of China's rise, this article investigates whether the soft power concept provides a new approach in analyzing a rising power. Firstly, empirical connections between soft power and the rise of China are established by discussing the Chinese idea of soft power. This is followed by an examination of how China adopts a soft power-based global strategy and wields soft power in its rise to a status quo power. The findings suggest that the soft power concept can be applied to analyze a rising power. Moreover, when a rising power tries to develop its soft power resources and wield its soft power, its revisionist policy orientation will greatly decrease. This in turn allows for a smoother transition to a status quo power.

'Apples and oranges'? Comparing Chinese and European Perspectives on the EU as a Security Actor.,"STUMBAUM, May-Britt U.",European Foreign Affairs Review,13-Aug,Kluwer Law International,INTERNATIONAL relations; INTERNATIONAL security; POLICY sciences; POLICY scientists; EUROPEAN Union -- Foreign relations; FOREIGN relations of the United States,,"This article aims to contribute to the research field of analyzing the external reception of European foreign policy by revealing differing meanings that European and Chinese analysts and policy-makers alike apply to key terms and concepts. These differences in meaning could present one factor that influences the diverging views of the EU's role between Chinese and European EU experts. Following the recalibration of the US foreign policy towards Asia-Pacific, also European pundits and policy-makers have been demanding a more active role in the region as well as engaging regional powers to joint efforts to cope with global challenges. Concurrently, the academic debate is becoming ever more intense. But how is the EU's role in security affairs in the Asia Pacific seen from the rising power of East Asia, China? Do assessments and analyses in Europe and China match each other? Or deviate significantly? The article aims to give an overview of the current state of debate on the EU as a security actor in general and specifically in the East Asian region in European and Chinese discourses and to identify factors that cause differences between both perspectives. It thereby takes three examples: a different meaning of key terms, deviations in approaches and deviations in the overarching theoretical framework for analysis. Depicting the differing meanings might provide a starting point for a research agenda on the factors and filters that influence norm diffusion from the EU to Asia within its foreign and security policy.

"ARE CHINESE NGOs ""GOING OUT""? THE ROLE OF CHINESE NGOs AND GONGOs IN SINO-AFRICAN RELATIONS.","Brenner, David",Journal of Public & International Affairs,2012,"Princeton University, Woodrow Wilson School of Public & International Affairs",NONGOVERNMENTAL organizations; INTERNATIONAL relations; FOREIGN business enterprises; CHINA; AFRICA; UN Millennium Project; INVESTMENTS,,"As Chinese investments on the African continent have grown, many African non-governmental organizations (NGOs) have expressed concern over the negative side effects of China's expansion on the continent on labor rights, local production, the environment, and local governance. Evidence suggests that Chinese government leadership realizes that it must effectively engage African NGOs in order to continue to advance its business goals in Africa. For this reason, the Chinese government has organized a variety of official NGO fora to augment the triennial ministerial-level Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) between China and African states. While these fora allow invited African NGOs to discuss issues related to the Millennium Development Goals with Chinese government-organized NGOs (GONGOs), the Chinese government remains reluctant to engage in substantively meaningful dialogue with African NGOs about issues of concern related specifically to Chinese investments in Africa. Instead, the government utilizes GONGOs as a liaison with African NGOs with the aim roman-age and restrict NGO involvement in Sino-African relations. Some GONGOs have, however, managed to distance themselves from the central government and have developed agendas of their own. Be that as it may, such GONGOs remain primarily concerned with promoting China's image in African countries rather than engaging with politically sensitive aspects of soaring Chinese overseas investments in Africa. Independent Chinese NGOs that promote environmental and social responsibility for Chinese enterprises in Africa do exist, however. At present, though, they remain a rare exception, as the bulk of China's NGO community lacks the resources, expertise, and networks to engage on issues relevant to Africa, and are preoccupied with China's own social and environmental problems. Furthermore, despite the Chinese government's promise to promote NGO involvement in Sino-African relations, it is far from supporting a greater international engagement by supporting independent Chinese NGOs, as it is doing with Chinese firms via its ""going out"" strategy.

It can be observed that harmony is more important than discord when Argentina accepts the new China's international division of labor, but when Argentina tends to consolidate the process of economic de-primarization, tensions between both countries tend to emerge. The crisis about crude soybean oil in 2010 is the clearest example to illustrate that trade tensions between both countries will be most frequent if Argentine industrialization continues and the process of policy coordination fails.

Arms sales are also a phenomenon that is greatly affected by globalization. This is certainly the case for Russia, especially as regards its arms sales to Asia. This article analyzes Russian arms sales to Asia and finds that despite Moscow's professed optimism that it can continue to maintain a competitive edge and its standing as a key Asian military power, there are many reasons for serious concern. These concerns relate to the quality of Russian weapons, to the domestic struggle for resources within a thoroughly corrupt defense industrial sector, and to external forces such as Chinese and South Korean producers who now compete with Russia in the global and Asian arms markets. Such trends may lead not only to a decline in Russia's overall standing and capabilities in Asia, but also to a transformation of Asia's strategic landscape.

Many analysts have questioned the wisdom of anchoring Australia's prosperity to being a quarry for Asia. The current mining boom has enabled Australia to postpone, but has not removed, the need to develop new industries to sustain a high standard of living in a future marked by global warming. Innovation is essential to the development of new industries that can contribute to a strong and sustainable economy, but cultivating innovation requires serious national commitment over the long term. This requires Australia to seriously reconsider education policy at all levels and to abandon what the author terms ‘rational choice populism’—a culture of anti-intellectualism and an unequivocal belief in a form of market fundamentalism—that discourages the advanced level of investment in human capital required for innovation.

This paper focuses on a mineral-rich region in the Philippines where China's resource-led diplomacy was first launched in 2007. Although foreign Chinese mining companies have made inroads into mineral-rich local communities, they have also encountered resistance from non-state actors, causing their operations to be disrupted and suspended. The authors argue that the local reception of China's resource-led diplomacy can be attributed to two factors. First, in light of the debate on 'China's globalization versus South East Asian state sovereignty', the growing strength of the Philippine state in resisting transnational mining endeavours hinges on the democratic space constituted by both state and non-state actors, resulting from political decentralization and active social activism. Second, it shows that the transnational Chinese actors have an insufficient knowledge base, in which they privilege a top-down state-centric approach that reinforces the patrimonial rule of the Philippine politicians. The authors conclude, first, that such patrimonial rule is largely made possible through the provincial governor as the key agent connecting the national state authority, local government units, mining operators/ investors and the affected villagers. Second, local resistance to resource-led patrimonial rule hinges on the formation of Philippine democratic space. This space remains transient and unpredictable in nature, and so cannot be assimilated into the patrimonial character of the Philippine state. Such democratic struggle is like wind, thunder and lightning -- hard to chase, hard to catch.

More broadly, the relevance of ASEAN in these polarizing times has come into question and subregional arrangements, such as the Ayeyawady-Chaopraya-Mekong Economic Cooperation Strategy (ACMECS) are emerging. Recent incidents point to growing Chinese assertiveness in the South China Sea. A reported agreement with Cambodia to build a strategic outpost on the Gulf of Thailand has drawn sharp criticism from Washington. But it is unclear how able or willing Southeast Asian governments are to push back since they view China as a critical economic partner.

A new politico-strategic landscape has emerged in which, ASEAN not only seeks China’s economic support perceived to be crucial for the development of the region, but also worries about China’s growing power and the possibility of Chinese domination over the region. ASEAN as a regional interlocutor has responded to the new phenomenon by deploying a hedging strategy that seeks to benefit from the opportunities and manage the challenges emanating from the rise of China. While ASEAN’s policy of ‘honest brokerage’ has allowed the presence of other powers to balance China, its policy of enmesh China has facilitated China’s role as a stakeholder in the ASEAN cooperative processes.

ASEAN's Evolving Institutional Strategy: Managing Great Power Politics in South China Sea Disputes.,Kei Koga,Chinese Journal of International Politics,Spring2018,Oxford University Press / USA,INTERNATIONAL arbitration; INTERNATIONAL relations; POLITICAL autonomy; SOVEREIGNTY; ASEAN,,"This article argues that a change in institutional strategy enables The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to manage its great power relations and prevent their abrupt political intrusion into the region by providing the policy options of pursuing institutional balancing, bandwagoning, hedging, or co-option. ASEAN's strategy is not only to choose optimal policy under a changing security environment, but also to create an institutional division of labour by proliferating ASEAN-led institutions to ensure, as far as possible, regional autonomy and Member States' security. Changes in ASEAN's institutional strategy occur when its Member States expect a change in the regional distribution of power. However, due to constraints created by the existing institutional design it is difficult to make any drastic alteration to the institutional strategy unless a radical change in the regional power configuration occurs. This article examines the cases of East Asia Summit and ASEAN Defence Ministers Meeting (ADMM)/ADMM-Plus during the period 2005-2016, the comparison of which illuminates the causes and processes of their strategy change and helps to deepen our understanding of the roles of regional security institutions.

Asia of Citizens beyond Asia of States: Regional Community Building in East Asia.,Nam-Kook Kim,Korean Journal of Defense Analysis,18-Mar,Korea Institute for Defense Analyses,INTERNATIONAL cooperation; INTERNATIONAL relations; NATIONAL security; INTERNATIONAL security; HUMAN rights,China; common interest; community building; East Asia; Japan; North Korea; shared identity; South Korea,"Recent security challenges in East Asia have provided an opportunity to realize the need for community building as a way of detouring military deadlock. This paper suggests two principles of community building in East Asia: (1) identity balanced by interest, and (2) an Asia of citizens beyond an Asia of states. These principles can be applied to the community building sub-areas of politico-economic, security, and sociocultural cooperation. The author examines the following topics accordingly: (a) an invalid concept of the ""Asian paradox"" and the statement made by Japan's prime Minister Shinzo Abe in the politico-economic area; (b) the Helsinki Accord and the EU Global strategy with their implication for East Asia in the security area; and (c) the Campus Asia program and the Asian Human Rights Court as a means to encourage sociocultural cooperation. With its complicated history of animosity and low levels of intraregional trade, fostering a shared identity and finding common interests in East Asia is no easy task. If some identities are given and others are chosen, it is important to manage the negative effects of identity and encourage the positive influence of its chosen dimensions.

It particularly welcomes White's intervention as a break from Australian International Relations scholarship's collective tendency to disengage from serious debates about public policy. It argues that while White's claims are plausible, the outcomes he paints are not as likely as he believes due to Chinese domestic economic and social constraints, the continuing ability of the CCP leadership to act autonomously of societal pressure and America's ability to politically manage its regional dominance. The article concludes by noting the absence of public debate about what China's rise means for Australia and the region and joins White in asserting the need to recognize that every strategic policy option it faces will impose new costs on Australia.

It argues that Indian suspicion of China has been premature. Beijing has not yet given its approval for major water diversion projects in Tibet, it has taken some limited steps toward easing the concerns of the Indian government and a growing number of Chinese experts have taken an interest in developing institutional frameworks for managing transboundary rivers. However, definitive settlement or cooperation will be difficult because both countries perceive themselves as the victim of a greedy neighbor. While India complains about China's ravenous exploitation of the Himalayan rivers, it is common in China to accuse India of exaggerating the Chinese threat and being unreasonable in its demands.

In addition, cultural institutes can provide additional business opportunities that lead to positive economic side effects such as increases in trade and foreign direct investment (FDI). In this study, gravity models were used to analyse the data for the Goethe Institut (Germany), the Cervantes Institute (Spain) and the Confucius Institute (China) to identify any stylised international patterns of the documented economic effects. The study finds significant positive effects on bilateral trade and FDI outflows for all three programmes, along with two important (i) the effects are stronger for non‐advanced economies and (ii) the effects are substantially larger on FDI than on trade. These results suggest that cultural institutes can be an effective policy tool in promoting FDI outflows, with the strongest effect realised when a home country locates its cultural institutes in host countries with developing economies. Importantly, results also suggest that the Chinese government's approach to extend its soft power through rapid expansion of Confucius Institutes worldwide has not been as successful as the efforts by the German Goethe Institut in increasing trade and FDI.

In particular, it considers how the postwar settlement of American regional primacy and economic dominance became built into the foundations of Australian international engagement and its long-term consequences. The first part of the paper explains how this occurred and why it is so important to Australia's current policy dilemmas. The second part of the paper examines how changes to the fundamental structures of the 1945 regional strategic settlement, focusing primarily on Northeast Asia, are driving shifts in Australian policy. It concludes with a reflection on the choices Australia has made about its strategic future as it is heavily invested in the belief that U.S. primacy can endure over the long term.

Australia’s 2017 Foreign Policy White Paper: Deconstruction and Critique.,"McDougall, Derek",Round Table,18-Jun,Taylor & Francis Ltd,GOVERNMENT publications; GEOPOLITICS; INTERNATIONAL relations; PRAGMATISM; PACIFIC Area; AUSTRALIA -- Foreign relations; AUSTRALIA -- Politics & government,Asia-Pacific; Australia; China; Indo-Pacific; South Pacific; United States,"The 2017 Foreign Policy White Paper identifies major themes and recommends preferred strategies in Australia’s engagement with the world. These themes and strategies relate to geopolitics, economics and the ‘new international agenda’; there is also a more specific focus on Australia’s Pacific island neighbours and Timor-Leste. There is a strong emphasis on perceived Australian national interests throughout the document. The geopolitical discussion is primarily ‘realist’; economically the document is pro-globalisation; the discussion of the ‘new international agenda’ involves an Australian-oriented pragmatism; there is an assertion of Australian leadership in the South Pacific. With some minor criticism, Labor has accepted the general direction advocated in the White Paper. The document is thus indicative of the likely future direction of Australian foreign policy. Lack of US response indicates declining US engagement with Australia and the Asia-Pacific or Indo-Pacific region. China, as the other major power highly significant for Australia, has been low-key in its criticisms.

Australian foreign policy and news media: national identity and the sale of uranium to India and China.,"Davis, Alexander E.; Brookes, Stephanie",Australian Journal of Political Science,16-Mar,Taylor & Francis Ltd,INTERNATIONAL relations; SOCIAL constructionism; MASS media; GOVERNMENT policy; URANIUM; AUSTRALIA -- Foreign relations; AUSTRALIA; AUSTRALIAN national characteristics,Australian foreign policy; constructivism; identity; media and communications,"This article explores the utility of a constructivist-media communications approach to understanding the production of national identity in Australia through a case study of the Australian Labor Party's 2011 decision to allow uranium sales to India. The decision came at a time when Australian foreign policy, political debate and news media discourse were increasingly concerned with India and China, as ‘rising’ superpowers whose prominence offered opportunities for economic prosperity even as it undermined settled regional power balances. This article finds that, rather than a matter of rational strategy, the decision was made in a context of considerable anxiety about the ‘Asian century’ as the Australian public, politicians and policymakers struggled to comprehend geopolitical change. It further argues that the constructivist project in international relations can benefit from engaging with insights from media and communications methodologies and by taking a less hierarchical approach to ‘elite’ and ‘non-elite’ discursive agency.

Australia's use of international education as public diplomacy in China: foreign policy or domestic agenda?,"McConachie, Bradley",Australian Journal of International Affairs,19-Apr,Taylor & Francis Ltd,GLOBAL studies; INTERNATIONAL relations; GOVERNMENT aid; CHINA; AUSTRALIA-China relations,Australia; China; foreign policy; international education; Public diplomacy; scholarships,"This research utilises expert interviews to investigate why the Australian Government funds the New Colombo Plan (NCP) and the Australian Studies Centres (ASCs) as public diplomacy in China. The ASCs have grown with no increase in funding, however, the academics view themselves as facilitators of Australian Studies not an arm of public diplomacy, despite their work contributing toward positive Australia-China relations. Evaluating the efficacy of the ASC's contribution to public diplomacy is fraught with risk. Some suggest that political activism may backfire when governments explicitly outline their soft power strategies. As the NCP has no longitudinal measurements, this research is an initial review of short-term achievements. However, the external survey with 16% return rate, and just over 50% response rate indicating an intention to act as ambassadors for the program, requires review by the funding department. The opportunity for the Government to send a positive message to China and the strong people-to-people networks fostered by the two programs' participants have the potential to influence the nexus between Australian foreign policy, international education as public diplomacy and public engagement with foreign policy. This alone, should be sufficient to justify continued funding, or in the case of the ASCs, increased funding.

Authoritarian Public Opinion and the Democratic Peace.,"Bell, Mark S.; Quek, Kai",International Organization,Winter2018,Cambridge University Press,DEMOCRATIC peace; INTERNATIONAL relations; LIBERALISM; POLITICAL systems; AUTHORITARIANISM; PUBLIC opinion; CHINA -- Politics & government,,"The ""democratic peace""--the regularity that democracies rarely (if ever) fight with other democracies but do fight with nondemocracies--is one of the most famous findings in international relations scholarship. There is little agreement, however, about the mechanism that underpins the democratic peace. Recently, scholars have shown that mass publics in liberal democracies are less supportive of using military force against other democracies. This finding has been taken to support the idea that the content of public opinion may provide one mechanism that underpins the democratic peace. Using a large-scale survey experiment, we show that mass publics in an authoritarian regime--China--show the same reluctance to use force against democracies as is found in western democracies. Our findings expand the empirical scope of the claim that mass publics are reluctant to use force against democracies, but force us to rethink how public opinion operates as a causal mechanism underpinning the democratic peace.

This article aims to explain Pyongyang's foreign behavior between 1995 and 2011 with a concept called the balance of dependence. Although it stood on the brink of collapse in the 1990s, the North Korean regime defied the odds and survived with the help of neighboring countries, namely South Korea, Japan, China, Russia, and the United States. This article intends to explain Pyongyang's foreign policy under Kim Jong Il by focusing on how it deliberately built a portfolio of dependence on its neighbors. I argue that North Korea's foreign behavior had been attuned to the rise and fall of assistance from other nations. It sought to disperse its dependence among a host of potential sponsors in order not to be exclusively reliant on a single donor state, fearing restrictions on its political autonomy. As long as its neighbors are willing to help out, Pyongyang will continue to play one sponsor off the others while making progress with its nuclear and missile programs.

Balancing Against or Balancing With? The Spectrum of Alignment and the Endurance of American Hegemony.,"Selden, Zachary",Security Studies,Apr-Jun2013,Taylor & Francis Ltd,HEGEMONY; BALANCE of power; INTERNATIONAL relations; INTERNATIONAL solidarity; NATIONAL security; UNITED States,,"During the 2001–2009 period when American foreign policy was internationally unpopular and perceived as unilateral, many states strengthened their security cooperation with the United States and facilitated the reach of theusmilitary. This behavior spans a range of actions along a spectrum from reaffirming traditional alliances to far more subtle forms of alignment. This pattern is in large part driven by the actions of regional powers such as Russia and China whose rising power pushes neighboring states to seek the assurance of the United States, and it has distinct implications for the endurance of American hegemony. As those regional powers seek to expand their influence, secondary states may increase their contributions to the maintenance of American hegemony, thus helping to extend it well into the future. They are less prone to do so, however, if the United States follows a strategy of restraint that calls into question its willingness to defend its hegemony. Therefore, a policy focused on maintaining American military preeminence and the demonstrated willingness to use it may be what sustains the cooperation from second-tier states that helps to maintain American hegemony.

Despite the changing international and regional security environments and Beijing's more balanced South Asia policy, this need is viewed in New Delhi as a major obstacle to enhancing mutual trust and improving bilateral relations between China and India. Conversely, without de-hyphenating Sino-Indian ties, the Pakistan factor will remain a point of contention in fully developing the increasingly important relationship between Asia's two rising powers.

Following the end of President Chen Shui-bian's term in office, which was marked by constant tensions and several crises with China, Beijing has colluded with his successor, Ma Ying-jeou to pursue a policy of economic integration with the mainland. Beijing's strategy toward Taiwan under Chairman Xi Jinping and his predecessor Hu Jintao has yielded positive results. The approach not only avoids possible military conflict with the United States, but receives support from Washington. Beijing's economic means, such as the Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement (ECFA), have enhanced Taiwan's economic integration with China and greatly increased the PRC's control over Taiwan's economy and society, helping to lock Taiwan into the mainland's orbit. Likewise, Beijing has developed tools that allow it to intervene directly in Taiwanese domestic politics. However, efforts to use ties with President Ma to bring Taiwan farther into the PRC orbit have backfired, resulting in a weakened presidency that cannot deliver Beijing's goals. Thus, Beijing appears to be looking ahead to the next two elections, trying to make as much progress as possible before Ma leaves office, while simultaneously trying to establish ties with possible successors and the opposition DPP. In 2012. Beijing's intervention assisted the reelection of President Ma. It is sure to try again in Taipei's mayoral election in 2014 and the presidential/parliamentary elections in 2016.

Being Uniquely Universal: building Chinese international relations theory.,"Wang, Hung-Jen",Journal of Contemporary China,13-May,Taylor & Francis Ltd,INTERNATIONAL relations; IDENTITY politics; LEARNING & scholarship; NATIONALISM; HEGEMONY; NATIONAL interest; COMMUNISM & international relations; SOCIALISM; BALANCE of power; SOVEREIGNTY; CHINA; CHINA -- Politics & government -- 2002-; CHINA -- Intellectual life -- 1976-,,"In this paper I address the question of how Chinese scholars participate in scientific knowledge production by appropriating Western IR theories, primarily by examining interactions between North American theories that claim universality and China-specific IR efforts. Drawing on post-Mao era publications and books, I discuss how increasingly independent Chinese IR scholars are portraying their country's rising status in international politics and identifying China's national interests, while still emphasizing socialist concepts such as anti-hegemonism. The result is a form of Chinese IR scholarship that combines Western IR language with a worldview that emphasizes a modern China within the context of traditional socialist foreign policy norms. I will argue that Chinese scholarly discussions about IR theory building reflect efforts to present ‘their rising China’ (as individually perceived) in the study, research, and development of IR theory in response to the appearance of modern IR methods that require new definitions and new roles for old socialist forms. In this context, identity concerns are more important than the actual theories being established or appropriated.

The authorities' attention is focused on social issues totally neglected by the regime of Saparmurat Niyazov. New schools were built, provincial hospitals have reopened, roads and railways are improving, land reforms, however small, are welcomed, and a modest decentralization has emerged. However, the general social situation remains tense: a total absence of public liberty, violations of religious rights, mostly unacknowledged massive unemployment, a loss of confidence of the middle classes, whose educational and professional opportunities have been reduced, increasing corruption of state organs, and rural poverty influenced by the social problems of recent years. Yet, the main long-term problem probably remains the country's lack of human capital, which was destroyed in recent decades and needs time to be restored.

Beyond Balancing and Bandwagoning: Thailand's Response to China's Rise.,"Murphy, Ann Marie",Asian Security,Jan-Apr2010,Taylor & Francis Ltd,INTERNATIONAL relations; NATIONAL security; CHINA; THAILAND; BUSINESS partnerships,,"This article examines Thailand's response to China's rise. Contrary to predictions made by power transition theories that states respond to rising powers by balancing against or bandwagoning with them, Thailand has reacted to China's rise with no fundamental change in its alignment posture. Thailand sees little threat but much opportunity in China's rise. Thailand is clearly not balancing; it has taken few measures to enhance its military capability or strengthen its alliance with the United States. This article argues that Thai policy can be classified as bandwagoning only under definitions that cannot be distinguished from foreign policy writ large. The policy implications of these findings are that the United States should not to take access to Thai bases or Thai support for a balancing coalition against China for granted.

Most accounts of Australia's links to India liken them to recurrent bouts of amnesia, arguing that Australia has not put the same efforts into engaging with India that it has into fostering ties with Japan, China and Indonesia and that, like a patient with injury to the hippocampus who has lost the ability to lay down long-term memories, Australia appears to approach each episodic moment of contact without recollection of the past. Australia's relationship with India has passed through distinct phases, from a brief moment of warmth in the years immediately after India achieved independence, through frosty decades of the Cold War. In contrast to many other accounts, the paper argues that since the 1980s Australia has sought with considerable consistency to engage with India and that the tenuousness of the relationship is primarily due to Indian indifference. Recent bilateral issues, including the supply of uranium to India and attacks on Indian students, have led to an enlargement of contacts which may signify that the engagement is at last becoming a mutual one.

What are the long-term prospects for this relationship? Will it continue on this negative trajectory or recover positively in the long term? Challenging the conventional view that supports the former conclusion, this paper argues for a positive outlook for the relationship in the long term. This is defended from a structural perspective relying on two long-term strategic trends for Northeast/ East Asia--the elevated uncertainty in the regional environment (due to North Korea and China's strategic rise); and the rising strain on the U.S. military presence in both countries. In response to these structural pressures, South Korea and Japan will adapt and adopt strategies to defend their national security within a reformed U.S. alliance structure and strengthen strategic cooperation through bilateral and trilateral (with the United States) means.

Especially since President Hu Jintao took up his position, the Mainland has endeavored to improve cross-Strait relations through the institutionalization of a series of sensitive issues, such as the proposals and signatures of some long-term accords aiming to advocate economic cooperation, promote social exchanges, weaken political opposition and foster mutual trust. By taking the Mainland's national development strategy shift, Taiwan's domestic reality and 'institution deficit' in cross-Strait relations into consideration, this paper analyzes the reasons, efforts and features of the Mainland's recent institutional-orientated policy transition.

Thus it is becoming the focus of attention of its neighbours and is achieving a prominence in the world political economy unparalleled in its modern history. To a great extent, China's success is the result of 'good neighbour diplomacy' such as 'win-win' and the policies of reform and openness of the past thirty years. However, despite continuity in policy, China's 'peaceful leap forward' since 2008 has changed the context of its external relationships. The increasing asymmetries between China and its neighbours, as well as decreasing asymmetry with the United States, require an adjustment of win-win values beyond mutual benefit to credible reassurance. As China's neighbours become more dependent, they also become more anxious concerning their interests. Meanwhile, China's relative gain on the US requires a different kind of confidence-building diplomacy.

Bhutan's Foreign Policy Determinants: An Assessment.,"Bisht, Medha",Strategic Analysis,12-Jan,Taylor & Francis Ltd,INTERNATIONAL relations; NATIONAL security; POLITICAL culture; INDIA; NEPAL; BHUTAN,,"This article assesses the shifting preferences of Bhutan towards the foreign policy determinants. Three determinants (national security, political culture and economic engagement) have been studied as they play a significant role in shaping Bhutan's policy behaviour. These determinants have been analysed with respect to India, Nepal and China, three countries that have been of critical interest to Bhutan's foreign policy. The main argument of the paper is that when security threats are high or medium, protecting territorial integrity, sovereignty and political culture shapes Bhutan's foreign policy and, alternatively, when security threats are low, economic opportunities determine Bhutan's foreign policy choices.

A sample of 94 articles from Indian sources and 106 articles from Xinhua News Agency (English) was examined using content-analysis techniques. Then is a clear divergence in the topics covered by the Indian and Chinese media during the time period reviewed, 3 November to 17 November 2010, which was selected to coincide with Myanmar's first nationwide elections in twenty years as well as the release of political prisoner Aung San Suu Kyi from house arrest. The Indian press provided more coverage of Suu Kyi's release and of Myanmar political affairs than the Chinese press, but neither India nor China covered Suu Kyi's activities in the days following her release. The Chinese press provided more coverage of economic affairs and the Myawaddy border crisis, which the Indian press ignored. Surprisingly, the press in non-democratic China attentively chronicled and promoted Myanmar's elections while the press in democratic India had very little to say about them. This suggests that on these issues, the press focus on what they perceive to be in tile national interest of their respective countries.

Within the region, Hungary is regarded as occupying a prominent position by Chinese people and the government for several reasons. Chinese relations have historically been good: over the past decade Hungarian governments have committed themselves to developing the relationship. This trend was further confirmed after the global economic crisis of 2008, when Hungary started looking for new opportunities in its recovery from recession. The ""Eastern opening"" policy was initiated after the crisis and partly because of it. Officially, this policy puts more emphasis on further developing Chinese-Hungarian relations than was previously the case, including increasing trade and investment. However, the outcomes of the policy -- such as the construction of the Budapest-Belgrade railway line -- can be evaluated in different ways.

While trade and investments have been the main element in these relations, they have assumed, especially under Brazilian President Lula da Silva, an important political dimension. Our hypothesis is that stronger ties between Brazil and East Asia, however difficult they will be to achieve, will become paramount in shaping a new global order, inasmuch as they may lead to a growing relevance of these countries in international politics. From a Brazilian perspective, East Asia may help the country attain its main foreign policy goals in the 21st century.

The argument made builds upon the theoretical aspects of the bordering practices in the current literature, and then examines three cross-border cases - Mainland China-Taiwan, Cyprus-Northern Cyprus and Moldova-Transnistria, to demonstrate different patterns of cross-border interactions and their achieved outcomes. It questions why border-crossing practices have either brought about normalization in degrees, or with a questionable value? This paper makes the conclusion that although border-crossing practices have normalized relations between adversaries, they have also simultaneously brought along self-perpetuating separation as most of the divisions still persist today. Redefining borders and facilitating cross-border interactions has only had a limited contribution to conflict management.

This, however, is not new, and in the wake of independence several African countries pursued indigenisation policies to bring ownership back to their own citizens. Now indigenisation policies thrive again, this time disguised in terms such as ‘empowerment’, but just as politicised as in the 1970s. Zambia is at the heart of this development. In the light of liberalisation, booming commodity prices and the increasing importance of Chinese investors, this article seeks to further our understanding of how processes of exclusion interact with domestic politics in Zambia. It argues that the Citizens Economic Empowerment Commission, a new institution to bring ownership back to Zambians, builds on a long tradition of nationalist policies in Zambia, while its actual work is strictly related to the critique of the growing foreign dominance over the economy, and in particular of the upsurge in Chinese investments.

Relying mostly on archival records and personal documents in English as well as Chinese, the article shows that the construction of the new ""black bridge"" was made possible because of the PRC's determination to achieve its policy objectives, the African-American activists' needs in fighting for racial equality, and the U.S. government's strict ban on travel to China. Both the PRC and the black activists were new to these transnational interactions, and they worked together in such an unprecedented manner that they redefined the nature and function of Sino-American cultural relations. The black bridge facilitated a limited flow of people and information but also carried misinformation that eventually led to greater misunderstanding and fiercer confrontation. The bridge began to fade in the late 1960s and early 1970s as Beijing was forced to readjust its policy toward the United States, which soon lifted its ban on travel to the PRC.

It starts by analyzing the former's mutual relations, focusing on how the ideational construct presented by Jim O'Neill in his ' BRIC hypothesis' became formalized as a leader-level diplomatic group at a summit in Yekaterinburg, Russia, in 2009. I evaluate how the BRICS have influenced international issues and whether 'cooperation' or 'conflict' characterizes their relations with key industrialized states, concluding that there has been greater multilateral cooperation since 2008, especially through international forums such as the G20. The BRICS partnership is one of unequals, significant for international economic relations primarily due to China. This has had important consequences as the Chinese government has prioritized economic cooperation with leading industrialized states. Influential countries can continue to benefit by enhancing multilateral ties in what are often nonzero-sum situations.

Evalúo cómo los BRICS han influido en asuntos internacionales y si su relación con los principales estados industrializados es caracterizado por la 'cooperación' o el 'conflicto', para concluir que ha habido más cooperación multilateral desde 2008, sobre todo mediante foros internacionales como el G20. La relación de los BRICS es de desiguales, lo que es significante para las relaciones económicas internacionales, debido en gran parte a China.

Bureaucratic Politics and Chinese Foreign Policy-making.,"Qingmin, Zhang",Chinese Journal of International Politics,Winter2016,Oxford University Press / USA,BUREAUCRACY; INTERNATIONAL relations; POLITICAL doctrines; COMMUNISM; DEMOCRACY; CHINA; CHINA -- Foreign relations -- 1976-,,"This article tries to bridge the bureaucratic politics model of foreign policy analysis (FPA), which is based on American foreign policy practice, and Chinese foreign policy studies. It traces the development and discusses the Chinese features of the bureaucratic politics model, and analyses the evolving bureaucratic political process of Chinese foreign policy-making. Its conclusion is that the foreign policy-making process of the People's Republic of China (PRC) has progressed from ideology-based 'line battles' to personal relationship (guanxi)-based in-party competition, and from factional competition under one paramount leader to government politics wherein many participants vie for different policies. As China integrates more deeply into the international community, and communist ideology loses its political validity in Chinese politics, bureaucratic politics in China exhibits more prominent Chinese cultural features, and at the same time shares greater similarities with the bureaucratic politics in western democratic countries. Therefore, to avoid rigidity, attention must be paid to variances in bureaucratic politics as applied in the Chinese context. Bridging FPA theory and Chinese foreign studies is hence both viable and beneficial for the construction of FPA theories beyond the United States and for China's foreign policy research.

Burmese Attitude toward Chinese: Portrayal of the Chinese in Contemporary Cultural and Media Works.,Min Zin,Journal of Current Southeast Asian Affairs,2012,Sage Publications Inc.,MASS media influence; CIVIL war; INTERNATIONAL relations; BURMA; CHINA; BURMA -- Foreign relations; CHINA -- Foreign relations,Burma; culture; media; migration; PR China,"This paper argues that since at least the mid 1980s, there has been an observable negative attitude among the people of Burma against the Chinese. Such sentiment is not just transient public opinion, but an attitude. The author measures it by studying contemporary cultural and media works as found in legally published expressions, so as to exclude any material rejected by the regime's censors. The causes of such sentiment are various: massive Chinese migration and purchases of real estate (especially in Upper Burma), Chinese money that is inflating the cost of everything, and cultural ""intrusion."" The sentiment extends to the military, as well: the article examines a dozen memoirs of former military generals and finds that Burma's generals do not trust the Chinese, a legacy of China's interference in Burma's civil war until the 1980s. The public outcry over the Myitsone dam issue, however, was the most significant expression of such sentiment since 1969, when anti-Chinese riots broke out in Burma. The relaxation of media restrictions under the new government has allowed this expression to gather steam and spread throughout the country, especially in private weekly journals that are becoming more outspoken and daring in pushing the boundaries of the state's restrictions.

Business as usual? Economic responses to political tensions between China and Japan.,"Li, Xiaojun; Liu, Adam Y",International Relations of the Asia-Pacific,19-May,Oxford University Press / USA,POLITICS & economics; GOVERNMENT ownership; EXPORTS; INTERNATIONAL relations; SENKAKU Islands; CHINA-Japan relations,,"What is the relationship between political tensions and economic relations? In this study, we explore this question by examining how Japan's nationalization of the Diaoyu/Senkaku Islands, a territory much disputed with China, has affected bilateral trade between the world's second and third largest economies. Using monthly data, we find that the nationalization imbroglio has negatively affected the amount of goods Japan exports to China, with the effect being most pronounced for highly salient and visible products such as automobiles and cameras; these experienced immediate and dramatic drops lasting up to 12 months. In contrast, raw materials and intermediate goods were not affected at all; some even experienced increased exports. These findings suggest that consumer and corporate responses to political tensions may follow different logics. For consumers, certain political tensions, especially those involving enduring territorial disputes, could override entrenched economic interests and preferences, at least in the short term. In these instances, it will no longer be business as usual.

Business Interests and US-China Relations on Climate Change*.,"Oh, Jennifer S.",Pacific Focus,12-Apr,Wiley-Blackwell,INTERNATIONAL economic relations; INTERNATIONAL cooperation; PUBLIC-private sector cooperation; GOVERNMENT policy; CHINA-United States relations,,"Cooperation between the USA and China serves as the lynch pin for the creation of an effective international climate regime. Recent US-China relations on climate change exhibit the contrasting pattern of active collaboration at the bilateral level and hostile relations at multilateral climate negotiations. This article argues that domestic politics, in particular business interests, largely explain the variation in US-China relations at the bilateral and multilateral levels. Due to the fragmented and decentralized structure of the climate policy community in the USA and China, business interests wield a disproportionately large influence over climate politics in both countries. Unlike multilateral climate negotiations that focus on universal benefits, bilateral collaborations on climate change projects deliver targeted benefits to business sectors through various government funding, support and favorable policies. As a result, business interests in the USA and China are quite supportive of bilateral climate change projects, while they oppose any endeavor to implement binding regulations in multilateral climate negotiations. Such observation implies that meaningful US-China cooperation on climate change will have to occur through bilateral projects that induce active private sector partnerships and private-public partnerships.

Politically, Cambodia is one of China's oldest and closest allies. Economically, China is Cambodia's top foreign investor, a major donor, and an increasingly important trading partner. Culturally, Chinese values are deeply embedded in many aspects of Cambodian society. However, China's dominance is surrounded by renewed controversies. While the government warmly welcomes Chinese aid, saying that it comes with no strings attached, many experts are concerned that China is providing aid for more nefarious reasons. Critics also accuse Chinese investment and aid of having exacerbated corruption, weakened governance and harmed human rights, and of ruining Cambodia's natural resources and environment. With such controversies, it is relevant and significant to assess the roles that China has played and continues to play in Cambodia's socio-economic development. Using expert interviews, media analysis and an extensive literature review, this paper uniquely contributes to the existing discussion on China-Cambodia relations by closely examining the controversies of China's investment and aid, critically analysing China's interests in Cambodia, and asking if the relationship between the two nations is a positive-sum game.

CANADA AND BILATERAL HUMAN RIGHTS DIALOGUES.,"Webster, David",Canadian Foreign Policy (CFP),2010,Taylor & Francis Ltd,HUMAN rights; INTERNATIONAL relations; TRADE regulation; CANADA; CANADA -- Foreign relations,,"Human rights have been asserted rhetorically as a goal of Canadian foreign policy for several decades. Beginning in 1997, Canada, along with other countries, began to turn towards the use of bilateral human rights dialogues (HRD) with countries considered to have poor human rights records. A study of these dialogues sheds light on the place of human rights in Canadian foreign policy, and on Canadian relations with Asia. Canada opened three dialogues, with China, Cuba, and Indonesia. This article positions those HRDs within the history of Canadian foreign policy on human rights and considers the origin of Canada's FIRDs as a way to demonstrate some action on rights, while avoiding any linkage between rights and the promotion of trade. It then examines the course of the failed I{RD with Cuba, the suspended dialogue with China, and the ongoing Canada-Indonesia HRD. HRDs became an end in their own right, showing few measurable results, and freezing out meaningful participation by civil society, while serving as an excuse to avoid multilateral action-a substitute rather than an addition to multilateral forums. The article proposes some conditions that should be met if HRIDs are to be continued, and suggests that effective rights advocacy would require a return to multilateral rather than bilateral forums, the integration of human rights into all aspects of Canadian foreign policy, and a willingness to accept the flaws in Canada's own human rights record. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Depuis plusieurs décennies, on affirme que les droits de la personne sont un objectif de la politique étrangëre canadienne. A partir de 1997, le Canada, comme d'autres pays, a commence a recourir aux dialogues bilatéraux sur les droits de l'homme (DDH) avec des pays considérés défaillants a ce chapitre. Une étude de ces dialogues fait découvrir la place qu'occupent les droits de la personne dans la politique étrangëre canadienne et dans les relations canadiennes avec l'Asie. Le Canada a entrepris trois dialogues, avec Ia Chine, Cuba et l'Indonésie. L'auteur présente les DDH dans le contexte historique de la politique étrangëre canadiennesur les droits de la personne et constate que ces DDH sont une facon pour le Canada d'afficher une action concernant ces droits tout en évitant de her cette preoccupation au développement du commerce. Il examine ensuite l'évolution du DDH avec Cuba qui s'est soldé par un échec, un dialogue suspendu avec la Chine et la poursuite du dialogue avec l'Indonésie. Les DDH sont devenus une fin en soi et ne permettent pas d'afficher beaucoup de résultats mesurables alors qu'ils freinent un engagement reel de ha société civile tout en servant d'excuse pour éviter une action multilatérale-soit une façon de remplacer plutôt que de completer les forums multilatéraux. Cet article énonce certaines conditions a satisfaire si l'on veut poursuivre ces DDH en indiquant que toute defense efficace des droits nécessiterait de revenir a des forums multilatéraux plutôt que bilatéraux, d'intégrer les droits de la persoime dans tous les aspects de la politique étrangëre canadienne et d'être dispose a reconnaItre les failles du bilan canadien en matiëre de droits de ha personne.

Canada's World: The Long Shadow of Geopolitics.,"Germain, Randall",International Journal of Canadian Studies,2017,University of Toronto Press,GEOPOLITICS; ECONOMIC policy; INTERNATIONAL relations; ECONOMICS; HISTORY; CANADA -- Politics & government; CANADA-United States relations,Canada and geopolitics; Canadian foreign economic policy; Canadian-American relations; Sino-Canadian relations; Canada et géopolitique; politique économique étrangère canadienne; relations canado-américaines; relations sino-canadiennes,"Canada has long been subject to the powerful cross-pressures of geopolitics and global demand for its bountiful natural resources. Looking ahead over the next quarter century, I expect that the most important impact on Canada's relations with the world will stem from geopolitical developments in the United States and Asia. Not only will demand for natural resources and commercial products from these two parts of the world exert an ineluctable influence over Canada's economic development, but so too will the fallout generated by the politics of China's rise and America's response to this new force. We might call this the shadow of geopolitics. As Canada attempts to diversify its economy away from an overreliance on the American market, rising Sino-American tensions will effectively shrink geopolitical space in the most important new market for Canadian trade and investment. The paradox is that as Canada is drawn into economic flows connected to Asia's political economy, it will also slide into the crosshairs of rising Sino-American geopolitical tensions. In other words, to the extent that Canada reduces its economic vulnerability to the United States, it will become more susceptible to geopolitical vulnerabilities in Asia. Ironically, over the next 25 years or so, economic diversification may well generate geopolitical vulnerability for Canada in its global relations. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Le Canada est depuis longtemps soumis aux puissantes forces concurrentes de la géopolitique et de la demande mondiale dont ses abondantes ressources naturelles font l'objet. L'auteur, en se projetant dans le prochain quart de siècle, prévoit que les répercussions les plus importantes sur les relations du Canada avec le monde seront celles qu'aura le développement géopolitique des États-Unis et de l'Asie. Non seulement la demande de ressources naturelles et de produits commerciaux provenant de ces deux parties du monde exercera-t-elle une influence inéluctable sur le développement économique du Canada, mais il en sera de même des retombées de la politique de présence accrue de la Chine et de la réaction de l'Amérique à cette force nouvelle, ce que l'on pourrait appeler l'ombre de la géopolitique. Pendant que le Canada s'efforcera de diversifier son économie en s'affranchissant de sa dépendance excessive à l'égard du marché américain, l'intensification des tensions sino-américaines aura concrètement pour effet de restreindre l'espace géopolitique sur le nouveau marché le plus important pour le Canada au chapitre du commerce et de l'investissement. Il est paradoxal de penser que, tout en étant entraîné dans les flux économiques liés à l'économie politique de l'Asie, le Canada glissera aussi dans le réseau des tensions géopolitiques sino-américaines croissantes. En d'autres termes, alors que la dépendance économique à l'endroit des États-Unis diminuera, sa vulnérabilité géopolitique à l'égard de l'Asie croîtra. Ironiquement, au cours des quelque vingt-cinq prochaines années, la diversification économique pourrait bien fragiliser la position géopolitique du Canada dans ses relations internationales.

Challenging Global Neoliberalism? The global political economy of China's capital controls.,"Vermeiren, Mattias; Dierckx, Sacha",Third World Quarterly,12-Oct,Taylor & Francis Ltd,"INTERNATIONAL economic relations; WORLD politics; INTERNATIONAL relations theory; CAPITALISM; GEOPOLITICS & economics; HEGEMONY; ECONOMIC globalization; NEOLIBERALISM; INTERNATIONAL organization; FREE trade; CHINA; CHINA -- Foreign economic relations; ECONOMIC conditions in China; EDUCATION; GLOBAL Financial Crisis, 2008-2009",,"This article engages with critical ipe scholars who have examined the rise of China and its impact on the neoliberal world order by analysing whether China poses a challenge to the neoliberal norm of free movement of capital. We argue that China's capital control regime is marked by a contradiction between its domestic social relations of production and its global geo-economic ambitions. On one hand, the key raison d'être of China's capital controls is to protect and consolidate an investment-led accumulation regime that redistributes income and wealth from Chinese workers to its state-owned enterprise sector. Dismantling these controls would result in changing social relations of production that would not necessarily benefit Chinese industrial and financial capital. On the other hand, China's accumulation regime has found itself increasingly constrained by the dynamics of US monetary hegemony, making the contestation of US structural monetary power a key global geo-economic ambition of China's ruling elites. In this regard, China would have to challenge the dominance of the US dollar by promoting the international role of the renminbi and developing liquid financial markets. Since it would have to abolish its capital controls in order to achieve this, there is a plain contradiction between its domestic and global objectives. A good understanding of this contradiction is necessary in order to be able to assess whether China will be capable of challenging the neoliberal world order in general and the norm of free movement of capital in particular.

At this point, South Korea is bandwagoning with China and deemphasizing its relationship with Japan. China-South Korea relations are not without problems, however, and Japan regards South Korea as one of the most important potential strategic partners in maintaining stability in Asia. In the future, the most decisive factor in determining the direction of the security relationship between Japan and South Korea will be China.

The Kim family's dominance of the DPRK since 1948 has confounded its critics and frustrated its allies in equal measure. Despite its dependence on economic aid from the former USSR and China, and later the USA, it pursues its nuclear ambitions at all costs. The regime has reneged on its nuclear and non-proliferation commitments, apparently only returning to the table to buy time to carry on building and testing weapons technologies. But what motivates Pyongyang to disregard UN censure and circumvent its sanctions, selling weapons and technology to fund its nuclear programme? Why does it remain one of the world's most militaristic societies, through years of economic penury and hardship? And after two nuclear tests and repeated incidents between the forces of the ROK and the DPRK, what are the prospects for peace and stability on the peninsula? In this account of the regime, the Kims' deep investment in nationalism is analysed in the context of the great political upheavals of the Cold War, the collapse of the USSR and the rise of China. This Adelphi looks at the events and ideas that shaped North Korean identity, as well as the factors influencing the great powers' reactions.

Although this represents a return to a long-established historical pattern, the ability of China's political elites to reassure nervous neighbours about the implications of its rise will be a major test of its evolving and increasingly sophisticated foreign policies. In this paper we focus primarily on China's regional engagement strategies, detailing the way such initiatives are understood in China, and the way they are received elsewhere. We focus primarily on the political and economic impacts of China's policies, and briefly consider their reception in Northeast Asia and Southeast Asia. We highlight the different dynamics and issues that China's policymakers must consider in each area, and suggest that despite some difficulties and tensions, on balance, China's policies are proving surprisingly effective.

Whilst that reputation may have been well earned, the analyses on which this conclusion is based are frequently flawed in two ways. First, by using an undifferentiated notion of independence, they tend to conflate sovereignty with less threatening expressions of Taiwanese identity and pro-democracy discourse. Second, by failing to take into account the impact of immediate strategic context, analysts ignore a fundamental element of democratic political communication. In our empirical analysis of more than 2,000 of Chen's speeches, we seek to avoid both flaws by unpacking the concept of independence and taking into account Chen's strategic relationship with his primary audiences. Our findings challenge popular portrayals of Chen, but more importantly they have strong implications for policy makers and students of political rhetoric with regard to current and future ROC presidents.

China and American Seapower in East Asia: Is Accommodation Possible?,"Manicom, James",Journal of Strategic Studies,14-Jun,Taylor & Francis Ltd,SEA power (Military science); INTERNATIONAL relations; MILITARY strategy; HEGEMONY; EAST Asia; CHINA-United States relations; UNITED States -- Politics & government -- 21st century; CHINA -- Politics & government -- 2002-,Accommodation; China; Freedom of Navigation; Maritime Security; United States,"Debates about the future of American seapower in East Asia turn on the argument that American seapower presents a risky and costly luxury that undercuts the cooperative potential of US–China relations. This article asks whether accommodation between China and the United States on the possession and exercise of American seapower in East Asia is possible. Accommodation on this front could significantly lower the risks of unintended escalation and in turn undermine arguments that favour an American retreat from East Asia. The article outlines how accommodation can be achieved on the exercise of American seapower in the region.

This paper examines China's policy and behavior in maritime cooperation in the East Asian region in recent years, a topic that has been insufficiently understood. I suggest that while it is necessary and useful to take into account China's naval power, more attention to Chinese intentions and policy on East Asian maritime issues is warranted to arrive at a more balanced, and arguably more accurate, understanding of China's role in East Asian maritime affairs. This paper takes stock of China's changing perceptions, attitudes, and behaviors in maritime cooperation in the region. I describe China's new policy moves in the South China Sea and East China Sea. I also address some of the major Chinese concerns for further maritime cooperation in East Asia. I conclude that while a grand cooperative maritime regime is still not possible from a Chinese perspective, China is likely to agree to more extensive and substantive maritime cooperation in many functional areas, most notably in the non-traditional security arena.

CHINA AND PAKISTAN: FAIR-WEATHER FRIENDS.,"Beckley, Michael; Azemati, Hanna",Yale Journal of International Affairs,12-Mar,Yale University,INTERNATIONAL relations; INTERNATIONAL cooperation; UNITED States; PAKISTAN; CHINA; STRATEGIC alliances (Business),,"Two assumptions dominate current debates on US foreign policy toward Pakistan. First, Pakistan shares a robust ""all-weather"" friendship with China centered on core national interests. Second, Pakistan's ability to turn to China in times of need insulates it from US pressure and renders hardline US policies counterproductive. Both of these assumptions are mistaken. First, China and Pakistan do not share a robust partnership; they engage in limited cooperation on a narrow set of interests, and these interests have been diminishing over time. Second, China will not take active measures to protect Pakistan from US pressure. As a result, the United States can impose punitive measures on Pakistan without fear of catalyzing an anti-American Sino-Pakistani alliance.

While South African President Jacob Zuma has publicly labeled the bilateral relationship ‘unsustainable’, a recent government document calls the Communist Party of China ‘a guiding lodestar of our own struggle’.

However, the ambiguities surrounding the implications of being “responsible” and of having “responsibilities” cause problems not only for the international system but also for the PRC in terms of its image, and others' reaction to the PRC. International and regional stability will be shaped by how far these aspects of power rise settle down in the PRC's interaction and presence in the international system and in the Asia-Pacific.

The country's total exports to Saudi Arabia surpasses those of the U.S. in 2009 and Chinese manufactures half the world's computers, clothes, and digital electronics. Its trade represents a shift in its foreign policy as its outlook has swung from responsive diplomacy to proactive diplomacy, although it still adheres to its non-interventionist stance. The change in the country's foreign policy is manifested in its moves to settle its border disputes and its increased involvement in international organizations."

China and the Future Status Quo.,"Womack, Brantly",Chinese Journal of International Politics,Summer2016,Oxford University Press / USA,INTERNATIONAL relations; CHINA -- Foreign relations -- 1976-; EAST Asia -- Foreign relations; CHINA-United States relations; CHINA -- Politics & government -- 2002-,,"Although China's underlying capabilities have developed at a fairly steady pace over the past 20 years and its ambitions have remained relatively stable, the shock of uncertainty and relative change since 2008 has driven an ongoing interaction between heightened international anxiety over China's rise and greater assertiveness on China's part. In academic circles, the question is raised whether China is a status quo power willing to be a stakeholder in the existing international system, or whether it has ambitions to be a revisionist power challenging the existing order. The resulting tension is especially acute in East Asia and in relations between China and the United States. Given the novel dynamics of the current era of global economic uncertainty, international normalcy should not be judged by the status quo of the post-Cold War era but rather by a 'status ad quem', a future situation of sustainable relationships in a post-hegemonic era. The prospective diplomacy of all states should be judged by the likelihood of their accommodation to a new era.

Security Council; CHINA -- Foreign relations -- 1976-; UNIPOLARITY (International relations); DEVELOPING countries -- Foreign relations,,"Although there is clear dissatisfaction in China with the nature of the current global order, it is hard to find a clear and coherent Chinese vision of what an alternative world might look like. This is partly a result of conflicting understandings within the country of the benefits and drawbacks of taking a more proactive global role and perhaps undertaking more leadership functions. But it is also a consequence of how elites frame Chinese interests and demands in different ways for different audiences. Furthermore, the existing order has in fact served China quite well in its transition towards becoming a global power. So while at times China appears to be the main driver for reform and change, at other times (or to other people) the emphasis is on China as a responsible stakeholder in the existing system. How others receive and interpret these conflicting signals is likely to be influenced by the way China exercises, rather than talks about, its growing power-perhaps most notably in terms of its territorial claims in the South and East China Seas and its role as a regional power.

Following a large ‘minerals for infrastructure’ agreement signed in 2008, China's activities in the DRC are often presented as an example of a departure from Western-led liberal peacebuilding and development, by providing ‘corrupt’ Congolese national elites with new sources of unchecked rents; or it is viewed as a positive alternative to Western approaches, by focusing on win–win development and reconstruction. Both these views are flawed. Rather than offering a marked alternative to a Western ‘liberal’ peacebuilding project, this article argues that Chinese interests have increasingly coincided with evolving Western interests in support of stabilization and market-driven economic activities. This, however, does not offer a clear pathway to security and development in the DRC. On the contrary, both Chinese and Western involvement in the DRC provide possibilities for continued insecurity, rather than any fundamental break from previous patterns and structures of politics.

Drawing on field interviews with former Khmer Rouge cadres and official DK records, it examines how the terms of the Sino-DK entente were understood by the parties and affected Chinese influence on the ground. The evidence shows that despite providing important technical guidance, China developed little influence over high-level Khmer Rouge policies, even when such policies put China's own interests at risk. The Sino-DK relationship illustrates the capacity of weak states to exercise considerable autonomy in asymmetric alliances and some of the dangers of relatively unconditional great power assistance.

China is a large and very populous country. However, China's role throughout its history has been more related to its civilisation and ideas than to its size. There have been wars and invasions, peace and tributes, but the overriding impression that one has of China's role in Southern Asia is that of ideas institutions. When China's century-old revolution culminated in the establishment of a Communist government in China, its role acquired a very crucial dimension. It is in intended to look into more general aspects of what the successful Communist revolution in China has meant and means to Southern Asia.

China and the responsibility to protect.,"Chen, Zheng",Journal of Contemporary China,16-Sep,Taylor & Francis Ltd,"RESPONSIBILITY to protect (International law); HUMANITARIAN assistance; INTERNATIONAL relations; CHINA -- Foreign relations; DARFUR Conflict, Sudan, 2003-; SYRIAN Civil War, 2011-",,"This article investigates the Chinese government’s evolving policies toward the emerging global norm of ‘responsibility to protect’ (R2P). While its principle of non-interference persists, Beijing has gradually acknowledged the responsibility to respond to humanitarian catastrophes in certain circumstances. Meanwhile, to ensure the concept’s limited application and reducing the instances where it might breach state sovereignty, Beijing actively participated in relevant debates to shape R2P in a direction that gives primacy to capacity-building and preventative measures. After examining how China engaged with the R2P in the recent crises in Darfur, Libya and Syria, the article argues, perceived threat from R2P upon its regime security explains Beijing’s continued efforts to constrain the norm’s development, while its aspiration for a status of responsible power encourages the Chinese government to engage with R2P more actively and flexibly. The case of R2P thus sheds new light on the complex interactions between China and the evolving global order.

China and the Struggle for Legitimacy of a Rising Power.,Yongjin Zhang,Chinese Journal of International Politics,Autumn2015,Oxford University Press / USA,LEGITIMACY of governments; POWER (Social sciences); INTERNATIONAL relations; WORLD politics; CHINA -- Politics & government,,"This article critically explores the historical transformation of the normative structure of international order brought about by legitimacy contests, and unpacks how power is deeply implicated in legitimacy claims amid the ongoing normative transformation of contemporary international society by virtue of the vanishing American unipolarity. By situating the analytical concept of legitimacy at the centre of this inquiry, it examines China's attempts to win and command social acceptance of the legitimacy of its rising power as it confronts the challenges posed by the changing normative structure of contemporary international society. The struggle for legitimacy of a rising power, it argues, provides an alternative analytical framework within which to understand how rising Chinese power contests and is contested by the liberal global order dominated by the United States, a question that has fascinated and consumed many realist, liberal, and constructivist scholars. China's engagement with the politics of legitimation is central to China's peaceful rise. A careful examination of China's struggle for legitimacy can yield insights into important systemic consequences of the transformation of the normative structure of international society.

China and the United States: a succession of hegemonies?,"CLARK, IAN",International Affairs,11-Jan,Oxford University Press / USA,"HEGEMONY; POWER (Social sciences); INTERNATIONAL relations; SOCIALIZATION; INTERNATIONAL cooperation; POLITICAL change; MATERIALISM; CHINA; UNITED States; RESEARCH; CHINA -- Politics & government -- 2002-; WIGHT, Martin; OBAMA, Barack, 1961-",,"This article critically reviews the suggestion that we are experiencing a 'succession of hegemonies' from the United States to China. It develops Martin Wight's writings on hegemony, and introduces a fundamental distinction (not made by Wight) between a power transition and a hegemonic succession. Wight held complex views about the nature of power and at times seemed to subscribe to a purely materialist account. Elsewhere he was more nuanced and appealed to the purpose of dominant states as part of his argument that influence does not correlate exactly with mass and weight. This suggestion is developed in the author's view of hegemony-as distinct from primacy-as denoting a legitimate practice within international society. These ideas are then superimposed upon current debates about a power transition, or a succession of hegemonies, as between the United States and China. The existing debate conflates those two issues. Accordingly, while it can readily be acknowledged that there are important indicators of a shift in the material distribution of power, this in no way amounts, as yet, to any kind of hegemonic succession. For the latter to occur, there would need to be clear evidence of an effective socialization of the aspirant hegemon's purpose and support for its preferred order. On the contrary, to date China has been largely content to operate within existing frameworks, rather than instigate a revision of them, and does not yet present a model for emulation elsewhere. It is possible that a power transition, without any hegemonic succession, could be corrosive of global governance.

The root cause of this tension is the dispute among the various claimants as regards the procurement of energy resources and securing territorial legitimacy. The entry of the US into the picture has further complicated the problem. In order to evolve a congenial regional environment, the disputing countries must evolve a collaborative outlook, not confrontationist, and adopt a regional perspective rather than proceed from their national interest only and take recourse to multilateral mechanisms as a means to reduce tension in the region. If the prognosis that the ‘21st century is the century of Asia’ is to be made a reality, then the economic prosperity and development of the Asian region will be essential, for which, all the disputing countries should change their mindset from local to global level and keep the South China Sea region as less tension-prone as possible.

It is argued that beneath the hype and hyperbole, anxieties can be detected that are no longer only about the prospect, but increasingly about the purpose, of China's rise to power. The author suggests that there is a particular and deeper 'cauldron of anxiety' which causes, and is caused by, a certain intellectual disorientation among those participating in the discourse. The rise of China remains a puzzle, as it presents a number of paradoxes, contradictions and ironies. The article examines two specific propositions and debates, on the return of authoritarian powers and on the future of the liberal global order. The author argues that a rising China raises a number of important questions about the way in which the transformation of China has been represented in the dominant Anglo-American discourse and the knowledge of China that such representations construct. The article concludes with the insight that China's pathway to power poses fundamental challenges to some intellectual premises and political wisdoms widely accepted in the West.

In Pakistan, there is a transition of power towards democracy, and controversy continues about the political process in the country. Pakistan, created as a model Muslim state based on religious nationalism, after six decades of nationhood suffers from a crisis of governance. China has strong bonds of friendship with Pakistan. The next decade will be crucial for Sino-Indian relations. China is attempting to strike a new strategic balance with India and follows a parallel diplomacy in dealing with India and Pakistan and pays much more importance to strategic and economic relations with its neighbors. Pakistan and China have resisted India's predominance in Asia. Pakistan's alliance with China is a grand alliance between Islamic and Confucian civilizations. China has supported Pakistan's claims over Kashmir, and military incursions into India by the Chinese forces are the major irritants in Sino-India relations. Nawaz Sharif's return to power has been hailed, but critics are skeptical. He has to face several challenges, and peace between India and Pakistan appears to be an illusion..

China in a World of Orders: Rethinking Compliance and Challenge in Beijing's International Relations.,"Johnston, Alastair Iain",International Security,Fall2019,MIT Press,INTERNATIONAL relations; NATIONAL security; EMPIRICAL research; DIPLOMACY; CHINA; UNITED States,,"Many scholars and policymakers in the United States accept the narrative that China is a revisionist state challenging the U.S.-dominated international liberal order. The narrative assumes that there is a singular liberal order and that it is obvious what constitutes a challenge to it. The concepts of order and challenge are, however, poorly operationalized. There are at least four plausible operationalizations of order, three of which are explicitly or implicitly embodied in the dominant narrative. These tend to assume, ahistorically, that U.S. interests and the content of the liberal order are almost identical. The fourth operationalization views order as an emergent property of the interaction of multiple state, substate, nonstate, and international actors. As a result, there are at least eight ""issue-specific orders"" (e.g., military, trade, information, and political development). Some of these China accepts; some it rejects; and some it is willing to live with. Given these multiple orders and varying levels of challenge, the narrative of a U.S.-dominated liberal international order being challenged by a revisionist China makes little conceptual or empirical sense. The findings point to the need to develop more generalizable ways of observing orders and compliance.

China in Africa: What challenges for a reforming European Union development policy?

At the same time, development exists alongside (and sometimes competes with) other policy fields, particularly in settings where the EU has strong economic interests. Reforms to EU external relations take place against a backdrop of rapidly intensifying economic and political relations between China and African countries, a debate often framed as increasing competition with the EU. This article argues that Chinese engagement in Africa poses challenges for the EU's development policy, but these differ considerably across African countries. We look at three country cases to show that China's increasing engagement with individual African countries does not cause EU collective action failures.

They examine the specifics of Chinese, Central Asian and Russian demography and analyze the impact of socioeconomic and demographic processes of the recent years on China's foreign policy. Having analyzed the volumes, dynamics, branch and regional specifics of China's investments in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan, the authors conclude that they can be described as a new form of realization of China's geopolitical interests in Central Asia and Russia. They have identified new forms of Chinese migration in the context of China's expanded investments beyond its borders, involvement of Chinese citizens in the ""golden visa"" programs in Europe and Mediterranean countries and revealed that, more likely than not, labor migrants follow the flows of Chinese money and business migrants, consolidating the economic and geopolitical aspects of Beijing's foreign policy. The authors have discussed the geopolitical, sociocultural, and economic role of Chinese diasporas in promoting the interests of their homeland and pointed out that the forms of Chinese influence in the world have become more varied.

The alterations in China's political interests connected to the issue of climate change are clearly evident in the domestic policy changes China introduced during previous years. However, China's leadership thus far has remained hesitant to translate this new set of interests fully into a coherent position in the international arena. China's mounting difficulties in reconciling its rapidly changing role on the international stage with its altered domestic situation, as well as its traditional foreign policy interests and principles, undermine its ability to pursue a consistent and effective strategy in international climate negotiations. China's reluctance to redefine its role in the international arena has led to a number of inconsistencies that particularly plagued its position during the Copenhagen conference, adding to the overall non-constructive dynamic of the proceedings that ultimately left China, as everyone else, with empty hands. The Copenhagen negotiations demonstrated that China's leadership will have to address these inconsistencies resolutely if it wants to realize the benefits that international climate cooperation offers.

However, in doing so, China has acquired large amounts of farmland abroad which has raised concerns among many developing countries. It has been argued that land grabbing in the developing world is a form of neo-colonialism. This role of a colonial power is in conflict with China's historical role, which presents China as a leader of the developing world. In order to bring these role expectations into conformity with each other, China has taken a more active role in global food security governance. It has brought food security to what is becoming the core of the global governance decision-making system, the G20. China's historical role, together with its growing economic power, has helped to push the G20 to understand the importance of food security. This has shifted the G20's understanding of economic global governance away from the traditional fields of banking and trade regulation toward understanding the developmental-oriented economic structure.

Its desirability and sustainability have been called into questions due to a wide array of challenges and developments. The rise of China is both one of the drivers of change as well as a key determinant shaping the emerging order. This article discusses what China's vision for a future international order looks like, what kind of impact China is likely to have on this order and how this will happen. By examining the ideas, concepts and practices which inform China's vision for the future, it argues that China will search for a liberal partnership order composed of an open economic order, a relatively more equal political order and a cooperative security order. To advance this goal, China will aim to preserve or even expand the liberal features of the prevailing order while curtailing its hegemonic nature. Instead of attempting to overturn the current order, China would pursue selective and incremental adjustments that overtime will lead to an order transition. Given current constraints, China cannot shape the emerging order in the same way as the United States did in the post-Second World War period, and the form and tempo of the order transition will depend largely on the outcome of Sino-US bargaining.

On the economic side, high levels of development, source of political stability and international recognition, exacerbate the need of importing natural resources and exporting manufactured products. Politically, the policy of national reunification, which is also an important provider of stability drawn from nationalism, demand strengthening relations with countries in areas attracted by Taiwan, isolating the island in the international arena. Beijing is actively working to increase its political leverage and shape the agenda of international politics giving South-South cooperation a strategic dimension well beyond mutual development. This fits South American objectives, namely the ones of Brazil, Argentina and Venezuela, that aim at diversifying international partnerships and perceive China as an alternative to the traditional orientation towards Latin America, the US and Europe. Positioning itself as a stakeholder, China creates the basis for an alternative international order using persuasion. The Chinese soft power in South America may be a drop of water in a much broader strategy.

These concerns are particularly heightened by China’s rapid military modernization of the past couple of decades. The announcement in 2010 that China considered its territorial claims in the South China Sea a ‘core interest’, can be seen as a setback to its regional diplomacy, so diligently crafted over the years and drove its Southeast Asian neighbours to seek closer engagement with the US. This article argues that the contradictions evident in China’s neighbourhood foreign policy reflect its continuing search for a model of international relations that can balance its domestic interests such as the need for political stability, including regime stability, on the one hand and its external ambitions for a decisive role in regional affairs, on the other.

The Chinese case vividly demonstrates how a non-European (or non-Western) country, as one of ‘the others’, has been dealt with and brought into the conceptualisation of international society by the English School. China's status in the conception of international society, to a great extent, has been invented by some of the English School scholars with Eurocentric bias.

Critics claim that across Latin America and the Caribbean, Chinese aid and trade are characterised by excessive state intervention. This article argues that, for two reasons, the rationale for these misgivings is dissipating. First, since the onset of the global financial crisis, China has gained influence in multilateral institutions, prompting them toward greater acceptance of public spending in developing countries. Second, recent developments in Cuba show that China is actively encouraging the Western hemisphere's only communist country to liberalise its economy. China sits at the crossroads of these local and global developments, prompting Cuba toward rapprochement with international norms even as it works to reform them.

Water insecurity itself will not likely lead to armed conflict. But when coupled with other international and domestic factors, it could increase the likelihood of war. China's water scarcity and its widening north-south water gap have increased pressure to execute controversial water diversion plans. These plans will threaten India, especially since the Brahmaputra River flows through a disputed area. These factors, plus changing domestic conditions in China, may increase the likelihood of war.

It considers the impact of international law on China’s own practices, and the contribution of China towards shaping international law. The article suggests that popular conceptions of a relatively isolated, sovereign absolutist China do not accord with contemporary legal realities, including in its dealings with natural resources. While China’s construction of strong sovereignty shapes its attitudes towards legal regulation, practice also suggests that China adopts a nuanced approach which includes legal compromise, and a commitment to multilateral regulation or bilateral diplomatic settlement of issues previously within the competence of national governments. China is often an active and constructive participant in contemporary law-making, even if – like all countries – it also seeks to instrumentally use international law.

China weathered the storm relatively well – avoiding a recession, in particular – not because it had ‘decoupled’ from the G7 economies but because its stimulus measures were unusually swift and powerful. One cost, however, has been a worsening domestic imbalance between investment and consumption that carries a heightened risk of asset price inflation, non-performing loans and destabilising levels of local government debt. Meanwhile, China’s ties to the world economy have not fundamentally changed since the crisis began. Despite stirring leader rhetoric and summit declarations, the BRICS have made only modest progress in meeting their goals. East Asia, North America and Europe remain China’s principal trade partners, and cross-border production chains connecting these regions remain the dominant mode of China’s incorporation into the world economy.

The debate largely focuses on how major powers, specifically China or America, can individually build an accommodating order. This article explores the causation of order-building in reverse by asking if the Sino-US relationship can create order as a by-product of individual attempts to build and manage security. It examines Chinese and American responses to North Korea and the South China Sea to demonstrate that order can be constructed through a complex set of negotiated interactions, which encompass cooperative, hierarchical, and consensus-building approaches to order-building. This “unhappy coexistence” implies that order as a by-product of state interaction is a useful but incomplete framework to understand security order-building.

The Communist mindset prevalent in China reduces the potential for insurgencies or uprisings. It focuses on the good of a community as a whole, not on an individual. This reduces the potential for staging coups or funding rebel forces in China to covertly undermine the current regime. The spike in China's economy results in a ""going global"" mindset and free market economy. International businesses have relocated their headquarters and factories to China for cheap labor and mass exports. China's government annually buys American federal debt, creating interdependency between America's and China's economies. The growth of China's military capabilities creates unrest in international and regional countries. China remains secretive about their military strategies, but openly claims a peaceful military growth designed to protect their sea trade lanes and amplify their weapon systems. Through military exercises with foreign countries, China expands their far sea expeditions and prepares for operations combating American weapons and forces. China's domestic alliances have developed due to the American war on terrorism. Two key allies are North Korea and Russia. North Korea threatens America with continued nuclear tests, while providing China with enhanced nuclear, biological, and chemical weapon capabilities. However, the fragile regime in North Korea injures China's global influence and foreign strategy. Russia has partnered with China since the fall of the Soviet Union, supplying them with fighter planes and other weapon systems and a common enemy against the United States. However, the competition between the two countries prevents their complete compliance and hinders their diplomacies. In order for America to covertly undermine China's global power, they must reduce their economic interdependency with China and capitalize on the vulnerabilities of China's domestic allies, namely North Korea and Russia.

This article examines whether those views are justified, after first establishing the importance of critically assessing all claims that a nation is turning into an adversary. The examination proceeds by summarizing the arguments of those who consider China an adversary in the making -- the 'adversarians' -- and the responses of those who hold China is leaning toward a peaceful development and should be engaged -- the 'engagers'. The discussion is organized into three segments, each analyzing the debate with regard to the different sectors of power: military/geopolitical, economic and ideational. The concluding sections explore alternative American responses to China's rising power in each of the three sectors.

By proving so, researchers will better understand the issues concerning the South China Sea and give insight into a perspective that is not largely debated. The strategy that was approached in this research and the methodology used was descriptive, analytical deductive. We followed to analyze a wide range of books and articles that are references in the domain. The results seem to prove that China's policy towards the South China Sea is directed towards multiple goals, such as avoiding containment, fighting for resources, protection of its energy security in the Malacca Strait and establishing itself as hegemon in the region. In those aspects, China's action in the South China Sea can be explained on the basis of achieving the means of attaining those certain goals. The hypothesis seems to stand to the degree in which a war would break out. Achieving sovereignty over the region, would endanger the passage of essential energetic inputs for relevant regionals actors and for the US, and can be used as a back-up plan of blackmailing those actors in the situation in which China's oil ship imports would be blocked in the Malacca Strait. Until then, China's actions in the South China Sea can be seen as the necessary steps to achieve this leverage in their position with the US and other regional powers. Therefore, we can state that China's policy towards the South China Sea can represent a preemptive measure based on reducing China's energetic security threat concerning a potential blockade of the Malacca Strait by the US or India, in case of conflict escalation.

Closer examination reveals that Chinese trade, investment and loans have supported the left-leaning governments in the region that are attempting to develop alternative postcapitalist societies. China’s leaders seek allies among the developing countries to join with them in creating a new multipolar and more equitable global order. The PRC has launched a new economic strategy that makes consumer demand the main engine of China’s economic development. It seeks to boost productivity, reduce the country’s growing income disparities, and pursue an environmentally sustainable path of economic development based on advanced high-value and clean manufacturing technologies and renewable sources of clean energy. The PRC’s goal of developing a new ecological civilization will provide opportunities for the Latin American and Caribbean economies to export a more diversified basket of goods to China and attract Chinese investments and loans into new areas such as renewable energy.La literatura académica occidental y la cobertura mediática de las crecientes relaciones económicas y políticas entre la República Popular China (RPC o China) y los países de América Latina y el Caribe incluyen prejuicios, miedos, y desinformación respecto a esas relaciones.

China’s South–South Cooperation with Latin America and the Caribbean.,"Harris, Richard L.; Arias, Armando A.",Journal of Developing Societies (Sage Publications Inc.),16-Dec,Sage Publications Inc.,INTERNATIONAL cooperation on developing countries; INTERNATIONAL economic relations; LATIN America; CHINA -- Foreign economic relations,Caribbean; China; development; Latin America; South-South Cooperation; win-win relations,"Since the formation of the People’s Republic of China (PRC) in 1949, China’s political leaders have given priority to securing the country’s sovereignty, national unification, and territorial integrity. This has involved pursuing foreign relations that contribute to an international environment that is conducive to the country’s peaceful development as a prosperous socialist society. In pursuing these strategic goals, the Chinese government and state-owned corporations seek to establish economic and political relations with the Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) countries that are based on the principles and practices of South–South cooperation (SSC). This essay focuses on the extent to which China’s relations with these countries contribute to their mutual benefit, promote their common development, and support the formation of a new multipolar world order based on peace, mutuality, equity, environmental sustainability, and international cooperation.

Although the Chinese government adopted an open and flexible attitude towards the TPP, it has moved strategically by accelerating the negotiations of the RCEP and China–Korea FTA, as well as updating its FTA with ASEAN. A more interesting development is China’s new initiatives for building two grand silk roads, one to Central Asia, leading on to Europe, and the other to Southeast Asia, leading on to the Indian Ocean. Both represent China’s renewed confidence in finding its role in Asia.

China-Africa Relations: A Neo-Imperialism or a Neo-Colonialism? A Reflection*.,"Lumumba-Kasongo, Tukumbi",African & Asian Studies,2011,Brill Academic Publishers,INTERNATIONAL relations; INTERNATIONAL economic assistance; ECONOMIC development; NEOLIBERALISM; IMPERIALISM; CHINA; AFRICA; AFRICAN Union; WORLD Trade Organization; UNITED Nations; CHINESE Communist Party; CHINA -- Foreign relations,neo-colonialism; neo-imperialism; neoliberalism; sino-phobia,"Based on the intensity and the volume of financial and economic dimensions as it pertains to the relationship between China and various African countries since the end of the 1990s, the debate on these relations has just begun within a global context. The discussion on the nature of South-South relations, especially between a newly emerging industrial country, located in Asia, and the African countries, which represent the least industrialized area of the world, has more recently brought the subject of the unequal balance of power between the two regions under intellectual scrutiny. Several intellectual debates on China-Africa relations have been mostly reactive in the sense that many analyses have focused on Africa's past relations with the Global North. The existing literature on these relations has, to a large extent, not sufficiently located the discourse within the existing dominant ideologies, namely neo-imperialism and neo-liberalism. It is also important to localize these relations within the World Trade Organization's dogmas and practices, the United Nations Charter, and African Union Charter in order to assess whether or not they can be characterized as either neo-imperialist or neo-liberal. Furthermore, it is important to identify on which specific areas these economic relations have generally focused and in which specific African countries they have been dominant. How do the Chinese government and the Chinese Communist Party perceive and define them? How do the African Union and specific African countries perceive and define these relations? And what are the policy implications in China and in the African public sectors? The main objective of this paper is, using the data and figures from Chinese sectoral investments and export-import of China and specific African countries to make a critical evaluative analysis of these relations and determine if they are qualified to be called neo-imperialist or neo-liberal. The article is both an empirically-based analysis and a reflection.

China's ‘charm offensive’ in the Pacific and Australia's regional order.,"Hameiri, Shahar",Pacific Review,15-Dec,Taylor & Francis Ltd,INTERNATIONAL economic assistance; GOVERNMENT policy; INTERNATIONAL relations; ISLANDS of the Pacific; PACIFIC States; CHINA -- Foreign relations; AUSTRALIA -- Foreign relations,Australian aid and foreign policy; Chinese aid in the Pacific Islands; Pacific Islands Region; Politics of aid,"In recent years, a perception has emerged among many policymakers and commentators that the deepening of the People's Republic of China engagement in the Pacific Islands Region, predominantly through its expanding foreign aid programme, threatens to undermine the existing regional order, in which Australia is dominant. In this article, it is argued that China's apparent ‘charm offensive’ in the Pacific is mainly driven by commercial, not political, imperatives and is far more fragmented and incoherent than is often assumed. Hence, its (real) political effects hinge, not on any Chinese strategic designs for regional domination, or even a more limited resource security agenda, but on the intent and capacity of Pacific governments to harness deepening aid, investment and trade relations with China towards their own foreign and domestic policy objectives, which include limiting Australian interference in the internal governance processes of Pacific states. This argument is demonstrated by the case of Fiji after the December 2006 military coup.

China's Anti-Access Strategy and Regional Contingencies: Implications for East Asian and Korean Security.,Taeho Kim,Korean Journal of Defense Analysis,12-Sep,Korea Institute for Defense Analyses,NATIONAL security; MILITARY technology; MILITARY modernization (Equipment); INTERNATIONAL relations; CHINA. Zhongguo ren min jie fang jun,"""anti-access"" strategy; China's ""military rise""; Russian weapons and military technologies; the Korean peninsula; the South China Sea; the Taiwan Strait","While China's new military capabilities are an issue of growing importance to regional security, it should be understood that they are very much a work in progress. It is also important to note that it is not China's military modernization per se, but its ability to project and sustain power along and beyond its borders--in particular, the possibility to resolve forcefully its outstanding maritime disputes and various contingencies in the region. This article argues that China's ""anti-access capability""--a U.S.-coined term originally developed for a Taiwan crisis--is equally applicable to other major regional cases such as the Spratly disputes and a North Korean contingency. Furthermore, notwithstanding China's continuous efforts to develop and deploy various types and classes of weapons/platforms, it is the Russian systems and technologies that are most capable and thus assigned to the highest mission-critical areas. In assessing China's current and likely future military capabilities as well as their implications for the region, it is necessary to take note of the following: It is very important not to ""overestimate"" or ""underestimate"" China's actual military capability, as war is most likely when China overestimates and others underestimate the PLA's capability. China's military not only employs mixed defense strategies but it also possesses both new and old (in fact, very old) military technologies. Its more than a dozen sources of foreign technologies are a nightmare for system integration and interoperability. There exists asymmetry of military capability between China and its weaker neighbors. While the PLAN is weak in several important aspects, many of its neighbors' navies are weaker still. Some have argued that China's foreign policy behavior apparently became more ""assertive"" in 2009-2012, but it is wiser to keep in mind that China has always been assertive and aggressive when it comes to what it defines as ""sovereignty and territorial issues"" as well as its newest ""core interest."" For Korean security it is imperative to take into account the geostrategic and historical factors. On top of the existing military threats from North Korea, the ROK should be able to employ a) a hedging strategy, b) ""limited defense sufficiency"" strategy, and c) rock-solid relations with the United States.

"China's Belt and Road Initiative Extension to Central and Eastern European Countries - Sixteen Nations, Five Summits, Many Challenges.","Musabelliu, Marsela",Croatian International Relations Review,17-Aug,Institut za Medunarodne Odnose,INTERNATIONAL economic relations; SOCIALISM; CHINA; CHINA -- Politics & government,Belt and Road Initiative; CEEC; challenges; China; economic cooperation,"The Belt and Road Initiative proclaimed by President Xi in 2013, a strategy developed by the Chinese government, is very important to China but is not confined to China. In order for the initiative to be successful it needs to be embraced by the countries on the terrestrial and maritime route indicated in the plan. In the late 1980s Deng Xiaoping proposed to integrate Socialism with Chinese Characteristics (Zhongguo Tese Shehui Zhuyi,中国特色社会主义) into global capitalism and in the 1990s the Jiang Zemin leadership initiated the Going out policy (Zouchuqu Zhanlue, 走出去战略) - the current Belt and Road Initiative is China's continuation in implementing those policies into actual deeds. China's accession to WTO in 2001 marked China's full integration into the global economy and since then the People's Republic of China (PRC) has become the largest trading partner for more than 180 countries. The Xi-Li administration has been extremely proactive since it was established in 2012; from that year on, Chinese behavior in international affairs has gained an ever-growing role as a forger of economic and diplomatic ties between countries. The primary example of this behavior is the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). As every serious foreign policy plan, the BRI is an accumulation of various other initiatives. For example, the cooperation mechanism ""16+1"", with which the PRC has approached Central and Eastern European Countries (CEEC), can be integrated under the BRI. This paper analizes the ""16+1"" China-CEEC cooperation mechanism in the context of the bigger BRI initiative, and tries to comprehend the economic and political factors intertwined with its implementation.

China's Core Interests and Dilemma in Foreign Policy Practice.,"Zhou, Jinghao",Pacific Focus,19-Apr,Wiley-Blackwell,"INTERNATIONAL relations; POLITICAL science; CHINESE Communist Party; ASIAN Infrastructure Investment Bank; XI, Jinping, 1953-",China–US relations; China's core interests; Chinese foreign policy; Chinese politics,"Although the term ""China's core interests"" appeared in Chinese media in the early 2000s, the notion of China's core interests has recently become the principle of Chinese foreign policy as part of the China Dream under the Xi Jinping administration. Guided by the principle of China's core interests, has China achieved expected results of the foreign policy practice? The recent development of China's relations with the international society, especially with the West, does not support a positive answer. Questions raised here are: If China continues to stick with the principle of China's core interests, how does China play it out in dealing with international relations? Is it necessary for China to reinterpret its core interests in its foreign policy practice in order to better serve the win–win cooperation within the liberal international order? This paper will address these questions by examining the relationship between the notion of China's core interests and its foreign policy practice, and argue that China could worsen its foreign relations if it were to overemphasize the principle of China's core interests in foreign policy practice. China should revisit the notion of its core interests and modify it in order to handle serious challenges from the international society.

More specifically, China's tilt towards regionalism has been propelled by three reasons: one its own rise, two its domestic concerns and three change in the world-order in the aftermath of the collapse of bipolarism and the resultant emergence of new threats and insecurities. Regionalism in Chinese discourse is rooted primarily in the quest for building a China-led regional order, supporting China's peripheral diplomacy and grand strategy, than on mere rationale of economic gains. Therefore, in Chinese conceptualization realpolitik issues hold primacy over normative and liberal notions of interdependence. The web of regional security architecture, thus, evolved serves essentially China's security needs and grand strategy.

Yet, despite its economic size and assumed importance, Beijing has not been able to alter the strategic alignment of even one significant power in Southeast Asia. In fact, every significant trading power in the region has moved closer to America in strategic and military terms even as their trading relationships continue to deepen with China. The article seeks to offer some explanation for China's incapacity to translate its supposed economic clout and importance into strategic leverage at America's expense. Analysis of the economic relationship between China and key Southeast Asian countries reveals that these economic partners are not as dependent on the Chinese economy as rising trade numbers suggest. Indeed, one should not overestimate the role of China in driving prosperity in the region, or assume that China has emerged as the primary driver of prosperity in the region. In reality, advanced economies and firms from those economies such as America's remain far more important to major Southeast Asian countries than does the Chinese economy and Chinese firms. Such a situation is likely to persist into the foreseeable future, meaning that America's economic capacity to seduce Southeast Asian governments and firms will remain robust and possibly even decisive.

'China's exceptionalism' is understood as a normative modality of engagement that seeks to structure relations such that, though they may remain asymmetrical in economic content they are nonetheless characterised as equal in terms of recognition of economic gains and political standing (mutual respect and political equality). This article considers the burden that the central Chinese government has assumed through its self-construction and mobilisation of a position of exceptionalism and, concurrently, the imperatives that flow from such rhetorical claims of distinctiveness in terms of demonstrating and delivering difference as a means to sustain the unity and coherence of these rhetorical commitments.

One puzzle that preoccupies international observers is the impact of leadership changes on Chinese foreign behavior. Based on an in-depth reading of official statements made by China's new political leaders and their first actions in office this paper analyses continuity and change in China's foreign strategy. Following a combined multidimensional analytical approach the evaluation focuses on the interrelation between indigenous (leadership changes, subsystemic challenges) and exogenous factors (global crises, critical junctures) on the modeling of China's international strategy. My main conclusion is that shifts and role changes in Chinese foreign policy should not be misread as the outcome of the latest leadership transition. Most 'changes' that are now associated with the fifth generation have originally been introduced by their political ancestors. As a context-sensitive, historical-reflectivist analysis shows, China's 'new' approach to world affairs stands for a continuing, incremental adaptation of the PRC to socio-economic evolutions on the domestic and the global level.

China's Future in a Multinodal World Order.,"Womack, Brantly",Pacific Affairs,14-Jun,Pacific Affairs,"POWER (Social sciences); INTERNATIONAL relations; POLITICAL stability; ECONOMIC stabilization; GLOBALIZATION; GROSS domestic product; SOVEREIGNTY; CHINA; ECONOMIC conditions in China, 2000-",asymmetry; China; demographic power; globalization; multinodal; multipolar,"Over the next twenty years China is likely to become the world's largest national economy, though not home to the richest one-fifth of the world's population. Chinese demographic power will be qualitatively different from American technological power despite bottom-line similarities in GNP, and China will face challenges of political and economic sustainability. Assuming that globalization, constrained state sovereignty and demographic revolution continue as basic world trends, the world order is likely to be one in which concerns about conflicts of interests drive interactions, but no state or group of states is capable of benefitting from unilaterally enforcing its will against the rest. Thus, there is no set of ""poles"" whose competition or cooperation determines the world order, despite the differences of exposure created by disparities in capacity. Although the United States and China will be the primary state actors and their relationship will contain elements of rivalry as well as cooperation, the prerequisites of Cold War bipolarity no longer exist. Rather, the order would be best described as ""multinodal,"" a matrix of interacting, unequal units that pursue their own interests within a stable array of national units and an increasing routinization of international regimes and interpenetrating transnational connections.

China and India are considered as the major players in the South Asian political affairs since the last six decades. No doubt China maintains close diplomatic relations with most of the South Asian countries but Pakistan occupies the center stage in China's foreign policy. Both Pakistan and China had an uninterrupted six decades long all-weather bilateral relations. Apart from good relations in economic, political and military areas, the nuclear angle is considered as the keystone of this relationship. However, it is argued by many scholars that Indian rivalry is the key factor of China-Pakistan relationship. India is known as a regional hegemon in South Asia and considered a major rival of both the countries. After the secession from India, Pakistan had fought three wars with India while China had fought one. Consequently, both the countries strategically tie down India's role in South Asia by providing assistance on various fronts to other smaller South Asian countries. The paper explores the China-Pakistan strategic relationship and how it challenges India's foreign policy in the South Asian region.

The other littoral states of the South China Sea have been troubled by the opacity of Chinese politics and of the process of military decision-making amid a proliferation of apparently separately controlled maritime forces. The more active role being played by the United States in the region, in part as a response to Chinese activism, has troubled Beijing. While most of the ASEAN states have welcomed America as a hedge against growing Chinese power, their economies have become increasingly dependent upon China and they don't want to be a party to any potential conflict between these two giants. The problem is that there is no apparent resolution to what the Chinese call, in effect, these ‘indisputable disputes’.

Design/methodology/approach--I review historical and contemporary scholarship, journalist reports, and unclassified government documents to argue for an alternative interpretation of current affairs. Findings--On the basis of my analysis, I found convincing evidence that China's overt and covert atavistic Cold War foreign policy includes a surrogate client-proxy relationship with North Korea that extends its reach into the Middle East as well as indirectly threatening the United States and its allies. Practical implications--My analysis of rational security adjustments by Japan, South Korea, and the United States to the North Korean nuclear missile program suggests a growing security threat may convince China to change policy. Originality/value--This research challenges the consensus view that China has distanced itself from North Korea because of its nuclear missile program. We may glean intentions from scripted narratives and symbolic gestures, but if one looks at China's behavior, a different view comes into perspective. From this more inductive view of the geopolitical situation, China's in-kind aid to North Korea helps underwrite Pyongyang's nuclear missile progress. It is time the international community observes behavior and recognizes rhetoric.

It is based on openness, harmony, inclusivity, mutual benefit and market operations and aims to connect the economically vibrant East Asia and the developed Europe by land and by sea, and in the process, it brings growth and development to tens of countries along the modern Silk routes. In this paper, we compare the impact of the main initiatives of OBOR, namely enhancements in physical infrastructure and improvements in border administration, on the trade of countries that have signed on to this project, especially countries along the six economic corridors. We find overwhelming evidence that shows improvements in border administration has the greatest impact on exports of corridor countries. Although physical infrastructure is important for trade, the Chinese government should place equal attention to improvements in trade facilitation to ensure trade routes operate seamlessly across the various corridors.

China's Partnership Diplomacy: International Alignment Based on Interests or Ideology.,"StrÜver, Georg",Chinese Journal of International Politics,Spring2017,Oxford University Press / USA,INTERNATIONAL relations theory; INTERNATIONAL relations; POLITICAL science; IDEOLOGY; INTERNATIONAL cooperation; CHINA,,"While it was impossible during much of the Cold War period to think about international cooperation absent the term ;alliances;, over the past two decades strategic partnerships have occupied a central position in many states; diplomatic toolkit. This article sheds light on such international alignment decisions by examining the case of China;s partnership diplomacy during the period 1990 to 2015. Theoretically, the analysis draws on scholarly insights into alliance formation and international cooperation to formulate two broad assumptions about partner choice which are based on interest-driven and ideology-based rationales of alignment. Binary regression estimations highlight the importance of economic interests in explaining partnership onset. In contrast to common arguments about alliance formation, partnerships seem unlikely to be driven by shared domestic ideologies. In fact, bilateral partnerships help to bridge ideological gaps and to enable, at least in the case of China, the respective partners; pursuit of economic gains and diplomatic preferences. With regard to the presumed payoffs of partnerships, the analysis further suggests that partnerships mean more to bilateral relations than purely nominal titles. Rather, they have measurable impact on partners; economic relations as well as on convergence regarding their views on the international order. China;s growing spectrum of partnerships, therefore, expands the country;s potential to exert impact on international political outcomes.

China's economic weight and growing political influence means that its foreign policies and the ideas that shape them have major consequences for established ideas about 'global governance'. Rather than accepting the institutional and ideational status quo, however, Chinese policy makers are actively trying to develop a new international order through the creation of new institutions such as the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, and the 'One Belt, One Road' blueprint for international trade and investment centered on China.

China's pursuit of free trade agreements: Is China exceptional?,"Jiang, Yang",Review of International Political Economy,10-May,Taylor & Francis Ltd,COMMERCIAL policy; COMMERCIAL treaties; INTERNATIONAL economic relations; REGIONALISM; FREE trade; LIBERALIZATION (Finance); PROTECTIONISM; NATIONAL characteristics; CHINA; WORLD Trade Organization; CHINESE Communist Party; MOTIVATION (Psychology),China; economic diplomacy; FTA; policy making; regionalism,"China is widely viewed as exceptional in its free trade agreement (FTA) activity for two reasons. First, the existing literature on East Asian regionalism has treated China as a strategic unitary actor. Second, Chinese policy elites claim that China is exceptional for its 'big country morality' of seeking to provide agreements that benefit smaller countries. What drives China's trade policy in the 'post-WTO' era? More precisely, does China, as a state ruled by a Communist Party, have different factors affecting its FTA policy-making than do other states? Is China pursuing FTAs 'with Chinese characteristics': are the motivations behind China's FTAs different from those of other countries? The research presented in this paper finds that China's FTA policymaking process involves a lot of bargaining and is particularly affected by the relative weakening of liberalizing forces vis-a-vis protectionist ones after the WTO accession. Moreover, the effectiveness of economic diplomacy is affected by coordination problems between economic and political sections within the government. Although China has a few motivations that go beyond what drives other countries to FTAs, those expectations are either difficult to realize or not very useful even if realized.

China's Raw Materials Diplomacy and Governance Cycle: Toward Sustainable Mining and Resource Extraction?,"BIEDERMANN, REINHARD",Issues & Studies,18-Dec,World Scientific Publishing Company,MINES & mineral resources; DIPLOMACY; POLITICAL accountability; INTERNATIONAL economic relations; RAW materials; SUSTAINABILITY,Africa; Economic diplomacy; international political economy; Latin America; metals and minerals; sustainable mining; transnational governance,"China's raw materials diplomacy and unregulated purchasing of minerals in Africa and Latin America, as well as its domestic raw materials export quota, have for years been eyed with suspicion by state and private actors. Industrialized countries want to uphold and extend free market access to raw materials, but also strengthen their political accountability and sustainability. However, critics argue that in contrast, China, the world's largest metals and minerals trading power, has taken the opposite course, ignoring social and environmental standards, reinforcing authoritarian governments, and erecting trade barriers. China is faced with several interrelated challenges in its resource diplomacy and governance. This article claims that an identifiable, chronological connection and pattern has existed between China's aid and investment diplomacy for resources since the late 1990s, free trade agreements since the 2000s, Beijing's resource nationalism since the 2010s, and the reform process of national and privately organized transnational governance toward sustainability in the present day. Is China socializing with emerging transnational standards on mining and resource extraction in the developing world, and if so, why? This article argues that China's raw materials governance, including corporate governance, has entered a phase of reform to pacify the external environment and to implement the Belt and Road Initiative. In theoretical terms, China's raw materials governance will continue to emphasize neoliberal and neo-mercantilist goals, cushioned by globalist features.

China's Rise and the Socialisation of Rising Powers.,"Thies, Cameron G.",Chinese Journal of International Politics,Autumn2015,Oxford University Press / USA,POWER (Social sciences); GREAT powers (International relations); INTERNATIONAL relations; SOCIAL systems; SOCIALIZATION; CHINA -- Politics & government,,"The rise of China, and other states whose material power and ideational aspirations have outpaced that of their peers, presents an interesting challenge to international relations theorists. Structural theories rooted in realism tend to predict that changes in material power inexorably lead to conflict that reshuffles the pecking order at the pinnacle of the international system. Such theories also tend to ignore identity and other ideational factors that may condition the interaction of rising and dominant great powers. This article develops a theoretical approach to state socialisation of rising powers. While considering the importance of increasing material capabilities, this approach also examines the types of roles that states occupy in the international social system and the ability of great powers to socialise rising powers into what they consider to be appropriate roles. The 1995-1996 Taiwan Straits Crisis is analysed through this theoretical framework to demonstrate that although both China and the United States attempted to altercast each other in a socialisation process, neither was successful. China pursued its own, self-conceived role conceptions in the situation, as did the United States, setting the stage for renewed rivalry between the two powerful states. The case demonstrates the difficulty of constraining rising powers' aspirations when their material power allows them to pursue the identities of their choice, even in the face of strong socialisation efforts from the dominant power and its supporters.

Administration officials emphasize that the rebalance involves a comprehensive diplomatic, economic, and military approach that pays more attention to India, Southeast Asia, and regional institutions; that the timing was dictated largely by the need for clear priorities to guide force development in an era of declining spending; and that demand by U.S. allies and partners for an increased U.S. commitment to the region played an important role in shaping the rebalance. U.S. diplomatic, economic, and military efforts to implement the rebalance demonstrate a significant increase in strategic attention to the Asia-Pacific region, matched by commitments of diplomatic, economic, and military resources, including the time of senior U.S. leaders. Chinese officials and scholars have reacted by expressing concern and skepticism about the stated U.S. rationale, lamenting the ""lack of strategic trust"" between Washington and Beijing, urging greater respect for Chinese ""core interests,"" and stressing negative consequences of the rebalance for Asian security (especially its supposed role in emboldening U.S. allies and partners to challenge Chinese maritime territorial claims). At the same time, they have redoubled efforts to stabilize Sino-U.S. relations and to build a ""new type of great power relations."" A key implementation challenge is making the rebalance robust enough to reassure U.S. allies and partners of the U.S. capability and will to maintain its presence in Asia over the long-term, while not alarming Chinese leaders to the point where they forego cooperation with Washington. U.S. and Chinese leaders should work to expand and deepen the scope of bilateral cooperation on common interests, while seeking ways to limit and manage competitive aspects of U.S.-China relations.

Following President Thein Sein's inauguration in March 2011, the Sino-Myanmar relationship was initially boosted by the establishment of a ""comprehensive strategic cooperative partnership,"" and China sought reciprocation for its long-time diplomatic support in the form of Myanmar's endorsement of China's positions on regional multilateral forums. A series of events since August have frustrated China's aspirations, however, including Myanmar's suspension of the Myitsone dam and the rapid improvement of its relationship with the West. Several strategic misjudgements contributed to China's miscalculations, including on the democratic momentum of the Myanmar government, on the U.S. -Myanmar engagement and on China's political and economic influence in the country. China's previous definition of Myanmar as one of China's ""few loyal friends"" and the foundation of its strategic blueprint has been fundamentally shaken, and China is recalibrating its expectations regarding future policies.

With access to Latin American markets, resources and investment destinations, China may sustain its economic and social progress that bases its long cherished dream of restoring its past glory of fuqiang (wealth and power) and rise as a global power capable of reshaping the current world system. The enormous economic benefits deriving from their economic cooperation and trade may persuade Latin American nations to accept the basic premise of China's economic strategy: that China's rise is not a threat, but an opportunity to gain wealth and prosperity. This will help China gain more 'soft' power in and leverage over its economic partners in Latin America, and thereby help it to rise in the global power hierarchy.

China's Strategic Penetration of Latin America: What It Means for U.S. Interests.,"Pham, J.Peter",American Foreign Policy Interests,Nov/Dec2010,Taylor & Francis Ltd,INTERNATIONAL relations; ECONOMIC development; NATIONAL security; ECONOMIC policy; CHINA; LATIN America,,"The emergence in recent years of the People's Republic of China as a significant force in Latin America and the Caribbean has clearly altered the traditional dynamic in a way that affects how the United States relates both to the region as a whole and to its individual countries. A close examination of the growing links that China has forged shows that while it is driven by the need to acquire access to stable supplies of energy and natural resources required to facilitate the country's economic development as well as to open new markets for its manufactured goods, geopolitical considerations are also at play. Among those are the desire to reduce the number of states in the region that still maintain diplomatic relations with the Republic of China on Taiwan and the promotion of a multipolar world order. It is within that context that conclusions can be drawn about both the economic impact of China's increasing presence on Latin America's development and its political and security implications for the United States. Finally, several elements are suggested for a more engaged U.S. policy going forward vis-a-vis its neighbors in Central and South America and the Caribbean.

China's 'Two Koreas' Policy: Achievements and Contradictions.,"Hundt, David",Political Science (00323187),10-Dec,Taylor & Francis Ltd,INTERNATIONAL relations; ALLIANCES (International relations); DIPLOMACY; SOUTH Korea; NORTH Korea; KOREA; CHINA; CHINA-Korea relations; KOREA (South) -- Foreign relations -- 2002-; KOREA (North) -- Foreign relations,interdependence; Sino-Korean relations; Six Party Talks; two-Korea policy,"China has long maintained a keen interest in events on the Korean peninsula, which Beijing considers to fall within the Sinic sphere of interest. The PRC has maintained a decades-long alliance with North Korea, and also achieved a rapprochement with South Korea, with whom China enjoys a burgeoning economic relationship. The PRC's pursuit of a 'two Koreas' policy has tested Beijing's diplomatic mettle during the past decade. In and of itself, the maintenance of strong ties to both Koreas represents a significant achievement. By reviewing recent developments in Chinese diplomacy towards the peninsula, this article highlights both the achievements and contradictions inherent in Beijing's two-Korea policy. North Korea has risked China's wrath by pursuing a nuclear deterrent, and by refusing to enact market reforms. In the case of the South, the government of Lee Myung-bak has strengthened its alliance with the United States and also sought to compensate for its growing economic interdependence with China by seeking free trade agreements with other states, including the US. The sinking of the Cheonan in March 2010 presents an opportunity to reflect on China's efforts to balance its ties with both Koreas.

China's use of soft power as a rising power.,"Paruk, F.",Politeia (02568845),2014,Unisa Press,POWER (Social sciences); INTERNATIONAL relations; CHINA -- Politics & government,China's foreign relations; economic diplomacy; good-neighbour policy; Joseph Nye; multilateralism; soft power,"China's foreign policy has been isolationist for most of the past 1 00 years. During the post 30 years it has gradually shifted to becoming a global power in international relations; in the process it has joined several multilateral organisations and played a key role in establishing its prominence within these organisations. This article focuses on China's use of ""soft power"" to conscientiously and strategically enhance its global appeal. China's diplomotic strategy uses multilateralism, economic diplomacy and a good-neighbour policy as three forms of soft power in order to increase its attractiveness in the international community and, together with its hard power, to manage its rise as a world power.

China-Taiwan diplomatic competition and the Pacific Islands.,"Atkinson, Joel",Pacific Review,10-Sep,Taylor & Francis Ltd,INTERNATIONAL relations; INTERNATIONAL economic assistance; ECONOMIC history; TAIWAN; CHINA; OCEANIA; CHINA -- Foreign relations; TAIWAN -- Foreign relations,China; Oceania aid; Pacific Islands; Taiwan,"China and Taiwan have become important actors in South Pacific affairs due to their diplomatic rivalry. Securing the diplomatic recognition of the Pacific Islands countries is expensive for China and Taiwan. There are limits to what the rivals are willing to spend, and they attempt to reduce costs. This dynamic shapes how Taiwan and China engage Pacific Islands politicians. It also motivates their high level official visits to the region, and how they engage South Pacific regional organizations. Despite criticisms that China-Taiwan rivalry corrupts and destabilizes the South Pacific, the issue of whether China and Taiwan's diplomatic rivalry has been beneficial or detrimental to the region remains contentious. China and Taiwan appear to have recently called a truce in their decades-old rivalry. This tacit agreement is still tentative, and the involvement of China and Taiwan in the region has yet to change significantly. However, Taiwan has reportedly begun to reduce funding, and is likely to reform its aid delivery in order to satisfy demands from the South Pacific region's dominant power, Australia, and to improve its image as a humanitarian aid donor. China is also likely to reduce funding while the truce holds. However, China considers its ties with South Pacific governments more important than responding to Australian pressure, and is unlikely to reform its South Pacific aid programmes as a result of the diplomatic truce.

It demonstrates that in some respects, the interests of China and Japan in CA are similar, as exemplified by their focus on mineral resources and political stability. However, these countries differ in their approaches and strategies there: China is inclined to follow pragmatic approaches, whereas Japan’s policy is a mixture of idealistic and pragmatic perspectives.

"Chinese firms 'going global': Recent OFDI trends, policy support and international implications.","Brink, Tobias ten",International Politics,15-Nov,Palgrave Macmillan Ltd.,FOREIGN investments; INTERNATIONAL business enterprises; INTERNATIONAL economic relations; ECONOMIC competition; CHINA; CHINESE corporations,,"This article analyzes Chinese foreign direct investment. First, recent empirical trends are explicated, showing that Chinese firms 'going global' has taken off, with significantly rising investment even in developed economies. Analyzing the specifics of Chinese outward foreign direct investment (OFDI) also shows that the motives of Chinese firms going abroad are mostly economic. Second, the role of policy support in Chinese OFDI is elucidated, showing that Chinese style internationalization differs from liberal role models. This is explained by the domestic structure of China's political economy. However, the prevalent image in the West that the internationalization of Chinese firms is mostly policy-driven is erroneous. Thus, third, the role of fragmentation and competition in China's 'going global' strategy is elucidated. In the outlook, it is exemplified that the growing significance of Chinese firms results in a restructuring of global competitive relations, which some Western governments and firms regard with suspicion.

Among other things, it contemplates possible links between Chinese outward FDI (OFDI) volumes and Argentina's domestic and foreign policies. It also analyses a mixture of successful and unsuccessful Chinese investment cases in the agricultural, chemical, and banking sectors in order to engage the debate about the drivers of Chinese OFDI (COFDI), with some stressing business and economic factors and others emphasizing the primacy of political factors. In regards to the former, my study shows that Argentine policymakers did not offer special accommodations to Chinese investors despite the pro-China proclivities of Argentine leaders and their country's economic and political need for China. Moreover, at the local level, Argentine politics actually proved to be an obstacle to successful Chinese deals. As for the latter issue, Chinese companies were not inclined to invest in Argentina because of the China stance of the Argentine government, but rather because they saw opportunities to exploit fertile agricultural soil, special tax regimes for investors, and opportunities to integrate into global value chain. My findings have a number of important theoretical and policy implications.

Research on Chinese foreign policy has again become of critical importance to the study of international relations and comparative politics. This article will begin with an overview of pertinent studies, categorizing them into cultural and non-cultural approaches, then it will re-examine the methodological problems associated with studying Chinese foreign policy making. Essentially, this article argues that that any research approach can generate methodological mistakes if undertaken without due care and attention. Rather, a multi-approach with emphasis on cultural factors will be a good model for future study. In other words, we have advocated an improved synergy of rational choice, structural, and cultural approaches. In the case study of Chinese foreign policy making between 2010 and 2011, the multi-approach provided a comprehensive picture of the Chinese thinking process behind seemingly irrational or illogical policy choices. It was the rising sense of frustration, the combination of over-confidence and self-doubt, which made foreign policy choices reflect the national interests at certain times and not at other times.

Ethnographic methodologies are employed to examine practices and discourses on agricultural governance among Chinese and Senegalese informants. Building on theories of agriculture as performance, I show how distinct repertoires for land management are negotiated and reshaped by different subjects in a kind of improvised dance, where individuals' improvisations lead to unanticipated project outcomes. What emerges is a picture of a Chinese agricultural management regime for African land that is simultaneously fraught with conflict, while also replete with collaboration benefiting some smallholder farmers. This actor-oriented approach provides a critical empirical lens as well as a research framework for engaging more constructively with Chinese in large-scale land acquisitions. I argue that 'land grabbing' must be seen not as a straightforward, linear process of state or corporate takeover of global land, but as a dynamic performance of negotiation among diverse state actors, corporate players and citizens - one that will reshape global development in unanticipated ways.

However, the applicability of this interpretation is quite limited when Sino-South Korea relations are examined. Though it is true that the anti-Korean sentiment of the Chinese has seriously grown in recent years, it has not affected the government's foreign policies to Korea. On the contrary, it has been played down or counter-balanced by the government, its media, and academics of China, as the period around the 2008 Beijing Olympics, when negative feelings surged, clearly illustrates. Chinese nationalism is not a threat to South Korea and cannot be generalized as a variable explaining Chinese foreign policies.

Chinese Values vs. Liberalism: What Ideology Will Shape the International Normative Order?,Yan Xuetong,Chinese Journal of International Politics,Spring2018,Oxford University Press / USA,LIBERALISM; VALUES (Ethics); POLITICAL attitudes; PRAGMATISM; INTERNATIONAL relations,,"The liberal hegemony of the United States is fading and faces the growing challenges from other ideologies including those from China. The question is which Chinese political values will guide China's policies in shaping the future international normative order. There are three political values compete with each other in China, Marxism, economic pragmatism, and Chinese traditional values. The Chinese government tries to combine Marxism with Chinese traditional values. Such effort, however, may find its difficulties in achieving the assigned targets. Although the US liberalism is losing influence, it is still the most influential global ideology and will not be abandoned overnight. China may find that it is possible to shape the international order by combining some Chinese traditional values with selected liberalist values, such as benevolence, righteousness and rites with equality, democracy and freedom, respectively. The combination can produce a set of modern values of wangdao (humane authority), such as fairness, justice, and civility. The new norms under the guidance of these values could be acceptable to most countries because of their universality, and will bring about a more peaceful international order than what we have today.

Understandably enough perhaps, less attention has been given to the way the relationship is understood in China. This article addresses this absence in the literature by providing an overview of some of the more important contributions to the discussion in China. The most important point that emerges from such an analysis is that there is an ‘asymmetry of interest’ in the two countries, with Australia occupying a far less prominent place in Chinese policy discussions than China does in Australia. Equally noteworthy is the fact that the study of Sino-Australian relations in China is characterised by a greater variety of perspectives than it is in Australia. Appreciating this diversity is an essential part of developing a more accurate understanding of the policymaking milieu in China.

Chinese Views on China's Role in International Development Assistance.,"Varrall, Merriden",Pacific Affairs,13-Jun,Pacific Affairs,ELITE (Social sciences); ECONOMIC development; POLITICAL realism; GEOPOLITICS; INTERNATIONAL relations; NATIONALISM; ECONOMIC development projects; CHINA; CHINESE economic assistance; CHINA -- Foreign economic relations; CONSTRUCTIVISM (Philosophy); CHINA -- Foreign relations; CHINA -- Politics & government,Chinese aid; Chinese Foreign policy; development theory; elite worldviews; nationalism,"China's increasing role as a provider of overseas aid is the subject of considerable debate both within and outside of China. However, despite research activity examining how Chinese aid is materialized, very little is actually known about why Chinese aid projects are developed or implemented the way they are. Although recent indications suggest the Chinese government is increasingly willing to be more open about overseas aid, for example, the release of the first White Paper on Foreign Aid in 2011, external observers remain largely unaware of the values, goals and motivations behind Chinese aid projects. Alongside this lack of information, non-Chinese analyses tend to be founded on a Realist approach to understanding international relations in which a ""rising power"" such as China automatically constitutes a threat to existing power relations. As a result, many scholars conclude that China's aid is part of a strategic quest to further its own geopolitical ends. This paper provides insights into the contentious topic of the drivers behind Chinese overseas development assistance. It finds that Chinese elites in the international development sphere do not share the views prevalent in Western international relations discourse about the international system and China's role within it. This article argues that exploring Chinese development actors' and commentators' conceptions of what development means, along with their views on China's role and obligations within the international system, allows a better understanding of the motivations behind Chinese aid, and a reexamination of some of the misconceptions around Chinese aid as a tool of Chinese geopolitical strategy.

CITIES AS THE NEW ENGINE FOR SINO-INDIAN COOPERATION.,Pengfei Ni,Journal of International Affairs,Spring/Summer2011,Journal of International Affairs,"INTERNATIONAL cooperation; INTERNATIONAL relations; CHINA; INDIA; SINO-Indian Border Dispute, 1957-; CHINESE history, 1949-; HISTORY of India, 1947-",,"Despite close geographical proximity and centuries-old ties, the relationship between China and India has been filled with obstacles and stumbling blocks. The majority of academic research and media reports tend to examine relations at the national level, yet cities have become increasingly important due to urbanization and globalization. This paper argues that, through the city platform, India and China can turn potential cooperation into reality. The differences between Chinese and Indian cities beget complementarity that provides great potential for cooperation. Local governments in both China and India have high levels of administrative power in decisionmaking. Cooperation between cities can avoid many obstacles that prevail in national-level cooperation. Local governments will not only be motivated to cooperate, but also can accomplish a great deal in promoting cooperation between the two countries. The conditions for city cooperation are improving. Cities can and should become a key path and a new engine for Sino-Indian cooperation.

Citizens and Condemnation: Strategic Uses of International Human Rights Pressure in Authoritarian States.,"Gruffydd-Jones, Jamie J.",Comparative Political Studies,19-Mar,Sage Publications Inc.,HUMAN rights; INTERNATIONAL relations; HUMAN rights violations; WOMEN'S rights; CITIZEN attitudes,China; human rights; intergovernmental relations,"Governments with strict control over the information that their citizens hear from foreign sources are regular targets of human rights pressure, but we know little about how this information matters in the domestic realm. I argue that authoritarian regimes strategically pass on certain types of external pressure to their public to ""internationalize"" human rights violations, making citizens view human rights in terms of defending their nation internationally rather than in terms of individual violations, and making them more likely to be satisfied with their government's behavior. I find strong support for this model through statistical analysis of Chinese state media reports of external human rights pressure and a survey experiment on Chinese citizens' responses to pressure on women's rights. This analysis demonstrates that authoritarian regimes may be able to manipulate international human rights diplomacy to help them retain the support of their population while suppressing their human rights.

Civil-military relations in Pakistan: a case study of Sino-Pakistani relations and the port of Gwadar.,"Boni, Filippo",Commonwealth & Comparative Politics,16-Nov,Taylor & Francis Ltd,CIVIL-military relations; ECONOMIC policy; NATIONAL security; INTERNATIONAL relations; HISTORY; PAKISTAN -- Foreign relations; CHINA -- Foreign relations; TWENTY-first century,civil-military relations; Gwadar; Sino-Pakistani relations,"This article analyses how the dynamics of civil-military relations in Pakistan have ensured policy continuity towards China. By looking at the development of the port of Gwadar, which represents the flagship project of Sino-Pakistani cooperation during the last 15 years, this article contends that the continuity in Pakistan’s policies towards China in the post 9/11 period is explained by a broad-based consensus among the Pakistani elites, in which, however, the military plays a dominant role. Civilian control over the military is a concept that was never fully absorbed in Pakistan and, as the analysis ascertains, most of the policies introduced by General Pervez Musharraf have been adopted by the subsequent civilian regimes under indirect control from the military establishment. The ultimate aim of the Pakistani leadership, civilian and military alike, has therefore been to provide a safe ground for the Chinese investments in the country because of the key role that China plays in Pakistan’s strategic posture. Organised around semi-structured interviews conducted in Pakistan in early 2015, the article is grounded in the relevant literature on civil-military relations and assesses the level of civilian control in three key decision-making areas pertaining to the port of Gwadar: economic policy, internal security and foreign policy.

Commentary on Hsu: Graduated Control and NGO Responses: Civil Society as Institutional Logic.,"Chan, Kin-Man",Journal of Civil Society,10-Dec,Taylor & Francis Ltd,NONGOVERNMENTAL organizations; INTERNATIONAL agencies; INTERNATIONAL relations; WORLD politics; CHINA,,The author comments on a paper by Carolyn Hsu on government-organized non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in China. He notes incidences that should not be interpreted as refuting the argument by Hsu that Chinese NGOs are interested in building alliances with state agencies to secure necessary resources and gain legitimacy. He also agrees with Hsu's observation that it was the state's capacity to permit or constrain access to non-state resources that made it necessary for NGOs to cultivate a relationship with the state.

While it is correct to move away from such a 'Euro-dominance', the theoretical lessons learned continue to have salience when applied to emerging and competing forms of integrative processes in East Asia. In particular, when economic considerations dominate regional relations - at times of economic crises - then integrative logics and strategies come to the fore. In more 'normal' times when geo-strategic considerations reassert themselves, then the consensus over region building and the very nature of the region itself is weakened and cooperation is replaced by competing visions and the over-supply of region.

The authors conclude that without the United States to hide behind, facing domestic and international constraints, and lacking substantial strategic reasons to remain outside the treaty, most holdouts will move toward ratification.

Focusing on East Asia, and taking a broad perspective that spans the economic and social dimensions of development, we contend that the path charted by the 'late development' model has become all but impassible. The path is now better conceived as one of 'compressed development.' Key differences are 1) the extent and consequences of compression; 2) the primary mode of engagement with the world economy-via global value chains; and 3) the interaction of these. Compressed development forces states to address a number of simultaneous challenges, resulting in 'policy stretch.' We identify key features of an 'adaptive state' suited to navigating the path of compressed development.

Nevertheless, essentially all of these nations have fallen short of simultaneously developing strong economies and health care systems, contributing to the emergence of health care inequalities, such as inadequate access to medicine, health care treatment and out-of-pocket spending. This is puzzling considering that most of these nations' economies burgeoned during the 1990s and early-2000s, thus potentially providing additional revenue for health care spending, while constitutional guarantees of universal access to health care and the presence of democratic electoral institutions in most nations should have incentivized governments to successfully address these inequality issues. Nevertheless, with the exception of South Africa, this study finds that waning political commitment to health care spending, increased foreign aid commitments and tenuous state-civil societal relationships accounted for these ongoing inequality challenges.

It begins with an examination of the analogy between the First World War and the current situation in East Asia and then goes on to explore the argument that transitions in power between the US and China heighten the prospects for war between the ‘declining hegemon’ and the ‘rising power’. However, the major aim of the article is to argue that constraints on conflict are insufficiently appreciated in the current discussion of the changing security order in the Asia-Pacific. In addition to conventional and nuclear deterrence, these constraints include: evidence of historical learning at the decision-making level; state agency at the regional level designed to shape and subdue major-power rivalries; new forms of economic interdependence; and the domestic political-economic priorities of the two main protagonists. While these factors certainly do not guarantee a peaceful Asia-Pacific over the next decade or so, I argue that they do impose forms of mutual and unilateral restraint.

South Korea and Taiwan share a similar historical past. Nevertheless, the Taiwanese did not have a positive image of South Korea after 1992, when South Korea broke off diplomatic relations with Taiwan in order to establish diplomatic relations with mainland China. This work is based on ethnographic research done in Taiwan and South Korea from 2001–2003 and 2007–2009. It explores how hallyu has contributed to the rebuilding of the image of South Korea in Taiwan. It discusses Taiwanese perceptions of this image and the role of the South Korean government in improving it. It focuses on how a once-held negative image of South Korea has been transformed. The hallyu boom inspired many Taiwanese to remark on the influence of South Korean dramas and pop music in renewing their relationship with South Korea. It has provided an opportunity for Taiwan and South Korea to build positive relationships after the break-up of their diplomatic relations. Through hallyu, South Korea became a country that Taiwanese want to emulate, a model nation for Taiwan today.

In contrast to revisionist and status quo paradigms, which view China as either a menacing threat or a constructive partner of the United States, this article advances a reformist paradigm that presents China as neither a follower nor an opponent of US policies. Rather, the reformist paradigm suggests that although China has placed a premium on its relations with Washington, it has also pursued stealthily obstructive policies in Iran that have enabled it to garner substantial narrow gains at the expense of compromising the US agenda in the region. The author calls this grand strategy opportunistic pragmatism.

The purpose of this introduction is to provide historical background to the articles comprising this special issue, whose contributors employ historical analysis, with the period preceding and following the Xinhai Revolution as a basis, to illuminate contemporary Chinese foreign policy - e.g., China's interest in remaking the international order and its security norms - or to suggest differences between past and present - for example, in regards to China's Asia- Pacific posture. This introduction also hopes to stimulate further work on Chinese history and foreign policy by highlighting similarities and differences between past and present with respect to, inter alia, pressures against China's territorial integrity, sovereignty, and independence, the penetration of foreign actors and ideas into China, and domestic factors limiting China's efforts to filter external influences and to respond to them.

Contending Ideas on China's Non-Alliance Strategy.,Liu Ruonan; Liu Feng,Chinese Journal of International Politics,Summer2017,Oxford University Press / USA,ALLIANCES (International relations); INTERNATIONAL relations; NATIONAL interest; NATIONAL security; STRATEGIC alliances (Business); CHINA; CHINA -- Foreign relations,,"As China's rise continues to shape its role in international affairs, Chinese international relations scholars are engaging in a lively debate about the country's grand strategy, particularly surrounding whether or not China should abandon the nonalliance strategy it has adopted since the early 1980s. Some scholars contend that a non-alliance strategy cannot safeguard China's national interests in the face of the United States' security alliance network throughout East Asia, and that without allies China's rise will be contained by the US. Pro-alliance scholars, therefore, are especially favourable towards a formal alliance with Russia. However, orthodox scholars in favour of supporting the official position of non-alliance argue that a formal alliance deviates from the fundamental principles of independence and self-reliance that have historically guided China's foreign policy. Moreover, a number of alternative strategies have been proposed to replace or complement the non-alliance strategy, among which are quasi-alliances, coalitions, and strategic partnerships. In practice, whether or not China forms alliances with other powers and neighbouring states depends on its self-defined role within the current international system, as well as its perception of external security threats. Considering both the external and internal constraints it faces, China is highly likely to maintain the non-alliance stance while pursuing other desirable approaches to making friends and partners.

Rather than focus on great powers and hegemons, the contributors address the contestation between regional powers, and secondary and tertiary states. The contributors address three questions: What are the drivers of different strategic responses? What are the different regional responses to shifts in the distribution of material capabilities? What is the influence of agency and structure in contested regional orders? To address these questions, different schools are employed including realism, institutionalism, and the English school to examine state characteristics, systemic, sub-systemic, domestic constraints and opportunities, the role of ideas and shared values, and different regional governance structures.

China's growing political and economic influence, regionally and globally, has prompted for different reasons the leadership of both countries to develop new channels and forms of communication. It has left Australian society with the unfamiliar task of engaging with a major center of power whose cultural and political traditions are radically different from its own. This article explores the scope and limitations of Australia's emerging dialogue with China. It makes the case for a sustained and multidimensional dialogue that harnesses more effectively the energies of civil society as well as business and government, thereby facilitating the task of redefining the relationship in a period of far-reaching transition.

While the USROC relationship has remained stable, cross-strait relations have experienced dramatic changes. Thus, it is a good time to examine the implementation of the Act by reviewing cross-strait relations. This article summarizes six historical eras in cross-strait relations: 1) military confrontation, 2) political standoff, 3) people-to-people exchange, 4) institutional negotiation, 5) political confrontation, and 6) peaceful negotiation. Three challenges facing the ROC are then examined in detail: 1) the ""one China"" principle, 2) arms sales and Taiwan's security, and 3) the ROC's international participation.

Cross-Strait Relations and the Way Forward: Observations from a European Integration Perspective.,"Fleischauer, Stefan",Journal of Current Chinese Affairs,2012,Sage Publications Inc.,"STRAITS; INTERNATIONAL relations; TAIWAN; TAIWAN -- Politics & government -- 2000-; MA, Yingjiu, 1950-",cross-Strait relations; ECFA; economic liberalization; integration; Taiwan,"The new policy platform in Taiwan of economic liberalization toward the Chinese mainland which was inaugurated by President Ma Ying-jeou (Ma Yingjiu) in 2008 has been the source of both expectation and anxiety. While some observers believe that this policy of rapprochement will usher in an era of cross-Strait prosperity and peace, others are concerned about Taiwan's de facto sovereignty as well as the negative economic impacts that the liberalization policy might entail. In particular, it has often been claimed (or feared) that the liberalization process will lead to some form of political integration between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait. In this article, I wish to offer some insights into the current state of cross-Strait interactions derived from the European integration process.

Crude 'Oil Mercantilism'? Chinese Oil Engagement in Kazakhstan.,"McCarthy, Joseph",Pacific Affairs,13-Jun,Pacific Affairs,PETROLEUM industry; FOREIGN investments; MERCANTILE system; INTERNATIONAL economic relations; COMMERCE; DIPLOMACY; ECONOMIC policy; KAZAKHSTAN; CHINA National Petroleum Corp.; CHINA; CHINESE investments; DEVELOPING countries -- Foreign economic relations; CHINA -- Foreign economic relations,China; Kazakhstan; national oil companies; neo-mercantilism; oil investment,"In 1991, the state-owned China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) commenced the first Chinese national oil company equity oil investment overseas when it invested in a UN-sponsored oil sands project in Canada. Since then, the CNPC and the other Chinese national oil companies (Sinopec and the CNOOC) have steadily increased their equity oil investments in developing nations, sometimes with the assistance of various Chinese party and government organs. Viewed in the context of China's burgeoning oil consumption and plateauing oil production, these investments have led to accusations by Western analysts and policy makers that China is engaging in ""mercantilism"" by ""locking up"" oil supplies from vulnerable developing nations to assuage their mounting energy-security woes. Through examining Chinese oil engagement in Kazakhstan, this paper will analyze whether accusations of ""mercantilism"" can adequately capture the complexities and dynamics that drive Chinese oil company investment in developing nations. This will be achieved by first surveying contemporary debates regarding Chinese oil engagement abroad and then linking these debates to historical and contemporary conceptualizations of mercantilism. This will allow for a new multi-faceted definition of ""oil mercantilist"" behaviour, which will shift the label from a statement of ethical value to a statement of empirical fact that can be tested. This definition will then be used to examine the institutional contexts in China that support and counter contemporary accusations of oil mercantilism, and then to explore Chinese oil engagement in Kazakhstan from 1996 to the present day. This paper will contribute to emerging literature that suggests Chinese oil investment and diplomacy cannot be simply understood through mercantilist perspectives. Analyses of Chinese oil engagement need to recognize the important influence that China's institutional reforms have had on Chinese national oil companies' increasingly commercial approach to foreign investment, in addition to the unique host-country contexts China encounters through its oil investments.

I argue that Russian and Chinese political elites view cultural statecraft first and foremost as a domestic priority that is directed toward the elaboration of a legitimating narrative for the regime. This process is generated in response to both domestic and international factors and can be viewed as an attempt to provide an inoculating defense against the penetration of neoliberal Western values. At the same time, this effort leads to tendencies toward a cultural exceptionalism that constrains both states in their attempts to employ cultural themes as an element of a foreign policy strategy.

Both the Czech Republic and Slovakia cherished an idea of making China an alternative economic partner. However, after 1989, China perceived these states as minor, almost unimportant partners, regardless of their efforts. Their profile was raised by EU accession but there was little change in their strength in terms of bilateral relations with China. The article investigates the failures and partial successes of the Czech and Slovak relationships with China, comparing their different approaches to the balance between focusing on political and human rights issues and the pursuit of economic and business interests.

Many of the BRICS' (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa) dominance in export markets for low-skilled goods pose a particular challenge for ""surplus-labor"" countries characterized by large populations of unskilled and underemployed labor. We theorize the incentives of firms and governments in surplus-labor countries to form South-South preferential trade agreements (SSPTAs) as a means of diversifying and expanding trade relationships in the face of this challenge. Of all the BRICS, our findings show that China poses the greatest challenge; the countries forming the most South-South agreements are those whose exports have been most displaced by China. We verify this pattern using both systemic and country-specific measures of the China ""shock."" Imports from China, in contrast, have no significant effect on SSPTA formation. Our account, which helps resolve the dual puzzle of declining trade with rich countries and the proliferation of SSPTAs in recent decades, underlines the implications of China's rise on the developing world.

Since new policies trigger various responses among scholars, it will help us to watch the diversification process within the academic sphere and see the different ideas behind different schools. Furthermore, observing the debates is an interesting way to gain a better understanding of China's foreign policy. By comparing the five key diplomatic transitions since 1979 with the five key debates in IR circles during the same period, this article articulates an interaction model between academia and government based on the consistency of ideas. This article also identifies six possible topics that Chinese IR scholars may debate in the future. It forecasts that the influence of certain minority schools of thought on these issues will grow, because policymakers are gradually changing their fundamental ideas.

Debating China's International Responsibility.,Mao Weizhun,Chinese Journal of International Politics,Summer2017,Oxford University Press / USA,INTERNATIONAL relations; NATIONALISM; ADMINISTRATIVE responsibility; CHINA; SCHOLARS; CHINA -- Foreign relations,,"'International Responsibility' has become one of the most significant topics in Chinese International Relations studies over the last decade. Although growing numbers of scholars have focused on this issue, there remains a low awareness of the need to explore its roots in China's academia, and to investigate the internal debates that display the different Chinese perceptions of international responsibility. This article provides a discourse-activation framework to explain why Robert B. Zoellick's speech polarized China's attention on international responsibility. It moreover constructs a typological framework based on dimensions that include the nationalism-internationalism orientation and degree of fulfilling international responsibility. It singles out three camps of scholars and their respective viewpoints on international responsibility and China's relevant policies in this regard, and demonstrates the 'divergent convergence' feature that characterizes the debate on the topic. In addition to this structural analysis, the article also summarizes the overall trend from 1950 to 2015 of the preventative to projecting preferences apparent in China's academic studies and political discourses on international responsibility. Subsequently, the article briefly investigates the possible factors affecting convergence and divergence of perceptions of international responsibility, which imply that fulfilling international responsibility is crucial to China's growing presence on the global stage, and that Chinese academics' attention to international responsibility should focus on collaboration towards improving the effectiveness of China's assertive behaviour in international affairs.

In East Asia the search for transborder urban linkages comes at a time when secondary cities in higher income countries are confronting major social and economic transformations. These new trends include: the rise of China in the global economy, the turn toward neoliberal downsizing of government, demographic transitions toward declining, rapidly aging populations with a diminishing labour force compensated partly by the large-scale recruitment of foreign workers and foreign spouses. The combined result of the new dynamics is that just when political power is being devolved to the urban scale, the global trend of""shrinking cities"" has reached them. The discussion focuses on recent initiatives of the local governments of Busan, South Korea, and Fukuoka, Japan, to build a ""common living sphere"" through transborder linkages to provide a culturally rich, people-centered alternative that contrasts with the high-technology industrial clusters being planned for them from their corporatized capital cities. In addition to economic issues, cities engaged in such transborder initiatives challenge the meaning of national borders and citizenship while also confronting new issues in accommodating the appearance of multicultural societies, which have all remained outside of mainstream discussions on decentralization.

Chinese foreign policy of the 21st century has become much more open and pragmatic in its relations with the outside world, more extensive in its reach and coverage, highly diversified in its functions and partners, more committed to international norms than before, and much more sophisticated in its dealing with the international community. Yet, the precise balance between the changes and continuities is still quite difficult to gauge. Furthermore, despite crucial visible changes, concerns and worries - even some fears - are discernible with regard to the rise of China. In the last 60 years, Beijing has sought hard to sustain consistencies (shizhong ruyi) in its foreign policy. Perhaps, that is the best clue the world has in inferring the future trajectory of Chinese foreign policy.

It will shortly discuss the existing research on the relationship between conflict and peace in East Asia and explain why democracy, as a possible cause of peace, has been hiding from the eye of observers. It will look at developments after World War II, but will pay special attention to the emergence of relative peace in East Asia after 1979. The main conclusions of the article are the following: Democracy is associated with peace in a two-way relationship., This association is neither very systematic nor linear., Countries tend to be more peaceful if they have a Polity2 score above 0 (while in previous studies a more demanding threshold has been found useful)., For autocratic regimes the relationship between autocracy and conflict is curvilinear. The most autocratic and the least autocratic autocracies are the least belligerent, while the 'murder is in the middle.'

We argue that Western powers are not unequivocally committed to the promotion of democracy and human rights, while non-democratic regional powers cannot simply be described as “autocracy supporters”. This article introduces the special issue. First, illiberal regional powers are likely to respond to Western efforts at democracy promotion in third countries if they perceive challenges to their geostrategic interests in the region or to the survival of their regime. Second, Western democracy promoters react to countervailing policies by illiberal regimes if they prioritize democracy and human rights goals over stability and security goals which depends in turn on their perception of the situation in the target countries and their overall relationships to the non-democratic regional powers. Third, the effects on the ground mostly depend on the domestic configuration of forces. Western democracy promoters are likely to empower liberal groups in the target countries, while countervailing efforts by non-democratic regional powers will empower illiberal groups. In some cases, though, countervailing efforts by illiberal regimes have the counterintuitive effect of fostering democracy by strengthening democratic elites and civil society.

After tracing the historical antecedents of India's constitutional order that defines India's democracy and serves as a framework for its politics, the article examines the myriad ways in which India's domestic politics influences its foreign policy - influencing its foreign policy priorities, affecting its bilateral relationships with neighbours (including Afghanistan)and rendering foreign policy decision-making difficult at times on sensitive issues (for example, in its relations with China, the USA and Pakistan).

The article examines the capacity of these democratic BRICS to serve as a role model to the rest of the developing world, at a time when liberal democracy seems to be experiencing serious challenges and dislocations in the Global North. The article considers the important achievements of democratic BRICS, in terms of their individual performances as well as through active cooperation strategies through organisations such as the India, Brazil and South Africa (IBSA) Dialogue Forum. Attention is drawn to the inherent structural dilemmas confronted by democratic BRICS to serve as genuine role models, given their domestic weaknesses as well as inherent constraints on their collective action strategies. Our central argument is that these countries, individually and collectively, are likely to have a crucial bearing on the future of liberal democracy on a global scale.

To inform this debate, this article examines theories that make competing claims about the stability of these potential transitions: theories within the 'democratization and war' school and economic interdependence theory. I compare the predictions of these theories in the cases of previous East Asian transitions in Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan. Process-tracing evidence shows that (i) xenophobic nationalism or logrolling by political coalitions were not present and that none of these countries pursued bellicose foreign policies during their democratic transitions. Evidence from these cases undermines the broad formulation of democratization and war theory and is consistent with a more recent, narrower version of this theory. Second, (ii) process tracing reveals the stabilizing processes of economic interdependence in all of these cases. Third and finally, contrary to prevailing views that warn of instability during future transitions, (iii) both the narrow version of democratization and war theory and economic interdependence theory forecast stability during the upcoming political transitions in China and Korea. These findings support foreign policy strategies of economic and institutional engagement toward China and the Korean peninsula.

A series of Chinese-built ports and airfields across the Indian Ocean comprises a grand ""string of pearls"" strategy within which Sri Lanka has become a crown jewel. The new forces of global power are geoeconomic, in which every capital in the world -- from Washington, Beijing, London and New Delhi to Karachi, Tehran, and Tokyo -- seeks out Colombo, Sri Lanka's capital, as part of the twenty-first century's latest ""Great Game."" More recently, in a failure of American foreign policy, Sri Lanka drifted toward Beijing as China's naval strategy gained momentum; however, the challenge for the emergent Colombo Consensus lies in navigating the freedoms and voices of its people -- not flaunting the laurels of its combative, defiant, and dictatorial leaders.

Differentiating the Politics of Dependency: Confucius Institutes in Cambodia and Myanmar.,"HSIN-HUANG MICHAEL HSIAO; HAO YANG, ALAN",Issues & Studies,14-Dec,World Scientific Publishing Company,SOFT power (Social sciences); INTERNATIONAL economic relations; HISTORY; INTERNATIONAL relations; CAMBODIA; KONGZI xue yuan; ASEAN; CHINA -- Foreign relations -- Southeast Asia; BURMA -- Foreign relations; CHINA -- Relations -- Southeast Asia; CHINA -- Politics & government; TWENTY-first century,Cambodia China; Confucius Classrooms; Confucius Institutes; Myanmar; politics of dependency,"Cambodia and Myanmar are both identified as ""pro-China"" Indochinese countries with regimes that rely on political support and economic investment from Beijing. Cambodia and Myanmar, therefore, have become testing grounds for China's new soft power initiative of ""spreading cultural understanding"" by means of the establishment of Confucius Institutes. China's relations with both Cambodia and Myanmar are improving, but local responses to the Confucius Institute initiative differ in the two countries. Phnom Penh has one Confucius Institute and three Confucius Classrooms equipped with thirteen Chinese language teaching stations, including those installed in the Royal Cambodian Armed Forces Academy and the Office of the Prime Minister . The initiative is enthusiastically championed by government and political leaders. In the case of Myanmar, three Confucius Classrooms, rather than Confucius Institutes, have been established by ethnic Chinese associations in Yangon and Mandalay. Lacking governmental endorsement, these Confucius Classrooms need to keep a low profile. The aim of this article is to differentiate between the politics of dependency in China-Cambodia and China-Myanmar relations by exploring local contexts and responses to Beijing's soft power initiatives.

Diplomatic Opportunities and Rising Threats: The Expanding Role of Non-Traditional Security in Chinese Foreign and Security Policy.,"Ghiselli, Andrea",Journal of Contemporary China,18-Jul,Taylor & Francis Ltd,NATIONAL security; INTERNATIONAL security; INTERNATIONAL relations; MILITARY policy; GREAT powers (International relations); CHINA -- Foreign relations -- 21st century; CHINA,,"Through the lens of securitization theory, this article looks at the significant impact that non-traditional security has had over Chinese foreign policy. Over time, non-traditional security has changed from being understood as an opportunity to boost China's international standing, to being seen as an important category within security threats. China's security and diplomatic behavior has changed accordingly. In particular, China has become more confident in using and authorizing force. This article pinpoints this process started in the 1990s by looking at the debate within the government and the legal, institutional and military response against those new threats. It also prompts important considerations about the drivers and the direction of Chinese foreign policy, and the general approach of studying the same subject.

"Disabling dissent: the colour revolutions, autocratic linkages, and civil society regulations in hybrid regimes.","Gilbert, Leah; Mohseni, Payam",Contemporary Politics,18-Sep,Taylor & Francis Ltd,NONGOVERNMENTAL organizations; DEMOCRACY; CIVIL society; INTERNATIONAL relations; AUTHORITARIANISM,authoritarian learning; autocracy promotion; civil society; colour revolution; Hybrid regimes,"State elites in hybrid regimes have increasingly sought to manipulate the legal regulation of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) as part of the growing backlash against democracy assistance in nondemocratic countries around the world. Sophisticated laws detailing burdensome NGO registration procedures and complex regulations enabling invasive government oversight of NGOs represent upgraded forms of civic curtailment and democracy resistance. This paper analyses these significant developments in a systematic, cross-national fashion over time by constructing a new dataset of NGO legal barriers in hybrid regimes from 1995 to 2013. It demonstrates that the expansion of repressive NGO regulations are shaped by international factors, particularly autocratic linkages, in the form of trade or defence pacts with Russia and China, as well as authoritarian learning from the colour revolutions. It thus contributes to debates on autocracy promotion and authoritarian resurgence by moving beyond the regime level to focus on the sub-regime dimension of freedom of association.

The article states that the politics of (in)security, conventionally accepted as ""objective"" and ""natural"", are in fact a socially, politically and lexically (re)constructed and (re)interpreted by nation-States. Discourse and meanings, in turn, can help (re)produce the effects of hostility and conflict between Nation-States. This article illustrates the importance of designing a language policy in international relations by taking U.S. president George W.

Chinese classic Yantielun or Discourses on Salt and Iron recorded a heated debate over the costs and benefits and economic foundation of imperial expansion shortly after the death of Emperor Wudi who had greatly expanded the Chinese empire. The managers of the empire argued for practical solutions such as state monopolies of salt and iron to centralize the state and conquer the nomadic Xiongnu and touted policy successes they achieved from this. Their scholar critics wanted moral principles rather than material calculations to guide policy and asserted that human suffering caused by monopolies and expansionary war would doom the empire. This tension between ideals and political necessities created an ideational foundation for the successful Chinese empire, which then lasted for two millennia. Strategic dialogues such as the one narrated in Discourses should on balance make contemporary Chinese leaders cautious in using coercive force. From early on, China has had its own imperial overreach and understands the cost of extensive adventures beyond its borders and how excessive reliance on force abroad might threaten their domestic political order, which is what the current Chinese government is most concerned about.

The analysis shows that: (1) all the reports are constructed with similar topics and schemata decided by the general rules set in the FPS of the report in 1986, which work as “orders of discourse”; (2) topical selection and schematic structure, as two sides of a mental model for the production and understanding of the discourse, are ideological mechanisms for the government to manipulate power control over policy construction and implementation; (3) the discourse is actually the final product of the struggle and interaction between new discourse and “orders of discourse”; (4) the discourse is a reflection of social changes and works as a catalyst to shape people’s view toward social reality and to mold China’s foreign policy practice.

Discussion on Whether the Korean Peninsula will be Included in China's Core Interests.,Han Kwan-soo,Korean Journal of Defense Analysis,15-Mar,Korea Institute for Defense Analyses,INTERNATIONAL relations; NATIONAL security; SENKAKU Islands; CHINA-United States relations; KOREA (South) -- Politics & government -- 2002-,China; core interests; Korean Peninsula; North Korea; nuclear security; refugees; sudden change,"This study aims to discuss whether the Korean Peninsula is included among the core interests claimed by China. The core interests of China are those interests that it is unwilling to negotiate over, and interests that they will even use military power to protect. China's official core interests have so far been limited to Taiwan, Tibet and Xinjiang, but their list of core interests has been expanding in scope since the Diaoyu/Senkaku Islands dispute. Furthermore, including the Korean Peninsula among China's core interests leads to an immense ripple-effect on not only South Korea but also the security of Northeast Asia and U.S.-China relations. This study analyzes the following research questions: What are the core interests of China? Is the Korean Peninsula included in China's core interests? Will the Korean Peninsula only be included in China's core interests in the event of an emergency? If it is included, what is the specific object or likely scenario? This study conducts an in-depth analysis of the questions above and provides policy implications for the South Korean government.

Divide and Conquer: The Impact of 'Political' Maps on International Relations.,"Pickering, Steve","Peace Economics, Peace Science, & Public Policy",14-Aug,De Gruyter,INTERNATIONAL relations; TREATIES; PEACEBUILDING; PEACE of Westphalia (1648); EUROPEAN politics & government,International Relations; maps; Westphalia,"For researchers and students of International Relations (IR), one date looms larger than all others: 1648. The end of the Thirty Years War, formalized by the signing of the Treaties of Osnabrück and Münster, led to a period known as the 'Peace of Westphalia.' Westphalia represented a fundamental change in the power balance of European politics: instead of the Holy Roman Empire holding supreme authority, power would now rest with states themselves, manifested in terms of sovereignty, territory and equality. One of the chief ways in which these 'Westphalian' states would cement this authority was through the use of maps. Before 1648, there was little on a European map to indicate where one country ended and another one began. But after 1648, this all changes: these new Westphalian states are represented with bright colors and clearly marked boundaries, defining borders and becoming an important part in creating the state and justifying its sovereignty. The role which maps have played in the spread of the Westphalian state is only just beginning to be researched. Yet the limited efforts to date have all focussed on Europe. This is unfortunate, as today, while Europe has, according to some observers, moved into a stage in which Westphalia is no longer a useful model with which to understand the state and the ways in which it relates to sovereignty, government, power and the individual, the old Westphalian model of the state has more recently been exported all around the world. This paper presents the first part of a project which aims to look at this expansion. The European angle will be presented in this paper; future research will be carried out in China, Japan and Taiwan.

Does a Stable Identity ensure ontological Security?

The discrimination and insecurity of roughly 30,000 talbukin living in South Korea, however, receives less attention. Design, Methodology, Approach: This article deals primarily with the concept of ontological security and presents an ethnographic description of a talbukin student's experiences of insecurity in South Korea. ontological security was first introduced in Anthony gidden's 1990 book The Consequences of Modernity, but has emerged as a dominant framework in studies of work and migration for addressing the link between neoliberalism, identity, and security. This article further addresses Valerie Walkerdine's approach to ontological security and neoliberalism and her claim that neoliberalism has intensified the distinction between internal and external in the process of self-formation. Findings: This paper reveals the significance of family and kinship relations in the creation of zones of exclusion and insecurity and the limitations of theories of security that focus on individual identity. I argue that talbukin find conditional security through neoliberal subjectification, whereas resistance limits agency and produces social, economic, and psychological insecurity. Originality: This paper presents a critique of giddens' 1990 The Consequences of Modernity and ultimately hopes to demonstrate that for talbukin in ""modern"" societies maintaining a stable identity produces insecurity. Practical Implications: Finally, this research suggests the need to move beyond a euro-American emphasis on the individual self, individual identity, and psychosocial border to bring into focus how ties between individuals and their families or nations affect security.

Does China Really Say No?

The main question asked in this paper is whether the Chinese government did resist this pressure from early 2002 to mid-2008. Judging from Chinese official documents, records released after bilateral meetings between the United States and China, testimony given by U.S. officials in the U.S. Congress, Chinese government policy statements, and measures related to the RMB exchange rate, we conclude that, in addition to economic and domestic factors, China's exchange rate policy was indeed influenced by American political pressure, and that this pressure led to reform of the RMB exchange rate regime and the widening of the floating band of the RMB exchange rate.

The research has been less attentive to how management varies depending on the issue area. This study examines the decision making of the Bill Clinton administration and compares the management of foreign policy on concurrent international economic and security issues. I find that there is little variation between cases in management style, but important differences within cases resulting from advisor influence and contextual factors. By examining the potential variations between issue areas, it is possible to better understand the connections between decision-making process, context, and the effectiveness of certain management styles.

Does democracy cause trade policy liberalisation? Unpacking the black box of trade policy.,"Chen, Chao; Li, Andrew X.",Journal of International Relations & Development,18-Sep,Palgrave Macmillan Ltd.,DEMOCRACY; INTERNATIONAL trade; COMMERCIAL policy; TARIFF -- Law & legislation; FREE trade; INTERNATIONAL relations; DEVELOPED countries; DEVELOPING countries,democracy; optimal obfuscation; tariff barrier; trade facilitation; trade openness,"This paper contributes to the ongoing debate on the relationship between democracy and the liberalisation of international trade. A number of well-known works in international political economy have argued that democracy promotes trade liberalisation. However, these previous studies have taken trade policy as a whole and largely ignored the sub-dimensions of trade policy. In this paper, we disaggregate trade policy into tariff barrier, trade facilitation and trade openness and argue that democracy reduces trade barrier and promotes trade facilitation, but does not necessarily make the economy more dependent on trade. We test our hypotheses using a panel of about 150 developed and developing countries in the period from 1974 to 2014 and estimate four equations to obtain four different estimators for each dependent variable of interest. Specifically, we investigate the effects of democracy on tariff barrier, trade facilitation and trade openness using pooled OLS, fixed effect (FE), instrumental variable (IV) and system general method of moments (GMM) estimators. Overall, our hypotheses receive good empirical support. With other confounding factors being controlled for, democracy is negatively associated with tariff rate, positively associated with the Logistics Performance Index, but there is no evidence that democracy increases a country’s trade openness.

It is undergoing dynamic evolution as a result of the Russian war in Ukraine. This article stresses that the bilateral relationship is one where both Moscow and Beijing espouse the logic of the strategic triangle vis-a-vis the United States. But Washington renounces the effort to deal with Russia and its Asian relations as a strategic entity. Moreover, over the last 12-18 months, although Russia has sought an independent standing in Asia apart from China, it is increasingly unable to compete with China or assert that independence, due to its invasion of Ukraine, isolation from the West, sanctions, and failed economic policies. Thus, it is losing out to China and becoming more dependent on it. These trends are apparent in Russian policies towards Japan, the two Koreas, Southeast Asia, and Central Asia.

In particular, this commitment has influenced Beijing's policy towards UN peacekeeping operations, with a long-awaited decision to add combat forces to the engineering troops and police and medical units that have been features of its past contribution. In addition, Beijing has doubled the size of its contribution to the UN peace operations budget. This article explains why the UN is a key venue for China to demonstrate its 'responsible Great Power' status and expressed willingness to provide global public goods. The main explanatory factors relate to the UN's institutional design, which accords special status to China even as it represents a global order that promotes the sovereign equality of states. Moreover, there are complementarities between dominant Chinese beliefs and interests, and those contained within the UN system. Especially important in this latter regard are the links that China has tried to establish between peacebuilding and development assistance with the aim of strengthening the capacity of states. China projects development support as a contribution both to humanitarian need and to the harmonization of conflict-ridden societies. The Chinese leadership has also spoken of its willingness to contribute to peacemaking through stepping up its efforts at mediation. However, such a move will require much deeper commitment than China has demonstrated in the past and runs the risk of taking China into controversial areas of policy it has hitherto worked to avoid.

I suggest that the difficulty Washington faces in getting China to address market access barriers in alternative energy needs to be viewed in light of both the coalitional dynamics in the United States resulting from the specific bilateral trade and investment relationship in this sector and Beijing's willingness to use industrial policy to foster economic competitiveness in nascent industries. Specifically, as China occupies the middle of the supply chain in the solar industry, both downstream users of low-cost Chinese imports and exporters of upstream products to China have voiced strong concerns about US trade action. Such domestic opposition, coupled with the importance of industrial policy for defending the country's long-term interests in a ""strategic emerging"" sector such as alternative energy, substantially constrains Washington's ability to influence Chinese policies.

Dramatic Change in North Korea: Instability and human Flight Propensity.,"Coggins, Bridget L.; Lafia, Sara; Torghabeh, Behzad Vahedi",North Korean Review,Spring2018,"McFarland & Company, Inc.",NATIONAL security; INTERNATIONAL relations; HUMANITARIAN assistance; BORDER security; KOREA (North) -- Politics & government,human flight; human security; internally displaced persons; migration; North Koreac,"Purpose: Though many forecast North Korea's political collapse, few explore the human flight that might result. Yet the timing, patterns, and responses to civilian flight in the event of major instability are critically important to Northeast Asia's security. Nearly every estimate of regime collapse anticipates that large refugee flows will prompt countervailing interventions from China and South Korea and its allies. Most of these numbers are, unfortunately, more akin to guesses than calculations. This research aims to improve upon the existing estimates. Design, Methodology, Approach: The paper uses quantitative data and case analysis to estimate and map North Koreans' human flight propensity. Findings: First, most scenarios thought to cause governmental collapse, crossnationally and cross-historically, do not typically do so. Next, tailoring its human flight analysis to North Korea's demography, geography and politics, it finds that substantially smaller numbers of refugees are likely to want to flee to China, and that they will flee more slowly than others estimate. Instead, most will remain within North Korea, becoming internally displaced persons (IDPs). Practical Implications: The results suggest significantly lower refugee-based, regional, military escalatory pressures. however, internally stranded civilians would pose a greater international humanitarian problem than anticipated to date.

Yet, Soviet miscalculation and misunderstanding of China's policy led them to substantially increase their economic assistance to East Germany, so as to 'win their German comrades back' to the Soviet side.

Economic and foreign policy issues facing New Zealand: some reflections.,"McGhie, Gerald",New Zealand International Review,Sep/Oct2012,New Zealand Institute of International Affairs,ECONOMIC policy; INTERNATIONAL relations; NEW Zealand; EUROPE; UNITED States; 2009-2017,,"The author reflects on the economic and foreign policy strategy for New Zealand. It cites ""The Major Economic and Foreign Policy Issues Facing New Zealand: 2012-2017"" report published in the June 2012 issue of the journal. He argues that New Zealand will have to adapt as neoliberal economics of the U.S. and Europe are challenged, citing the rise of China. He asserts that the government must consider concerns of the whole population in policies in order for them to accept making sacrifices."
Economic Cooperation in the Asia-Pacific and the Global Trading System.,"Armstrong, Shiro",Asia & the Pacific Policy Studies,14-Sep,Wiley-Blackwell,INTERNATIONAL economic relations; INTERNATIONAL economic integration; INTERNATIONAL trade dispute resolution; TRADE regulation; CHINA; JAPAN,economic cooperation; international governance; international trade; multilateralism; WTO,"The global trading system has underpinned huge growth in trade and the integration of economies that have signed on to it, whether they are political allies or not-none more so than in the Asia-Pacific region. It has prevented political disputes between Japan and China adversely affecting trade and investment flows between the two countries. The World Trade Organisation continues to play an important role. This is evidenced by the number of countries still willing to join the organisation, its record in keeping markets open during crises and the effectiveness of the dispute settlement mechanism. Yet the global trading system faces challenges. The rules and agenda, as well as the single undertaking mode of negotiations, are not effective or relevant to commerce in the twenty-first century. The shift to mega-regional agreements further undermines its primacy. A weakened global trading system could also have negative spillovers for political relations between countries.

Economic Openness and Great Power Competition: Lessons for China and the United States.,"Professor, David A Lake",Chinese Journal of International Politics,Autumn2018,Oxford University Press / USA,BALANCE of power; INTERNATIONAL economic relations; ECONOMIC competition; GREAT powers (International relations); FOREIGN relations of the United States,,"The United States–China relationship is more likely than not to slide into economic and military competition, despite the perhaps best intentions of both states. This new bipolar competition is not inevitable. The key question is whether both governments have the self-restraint to limit domestic rent-seeking interests who will undoubtedly demand protection at home and exclusivity in their spheres of influence abroad. If not, the new superpowers will, like great powers in the past, ‘race’ for economic privileges that can quickly divide the world up into exclusive blocs. Like the security dilemma, great powers need not actually exclude one another from their economic zones; the fear of exclusion alone is enough to ignite the process of division. There was always some likelihood of a competitive economic spiral given China’s close business–government relations in a ‘state-capitalist’ economy. Now, for the first time in seven decades, there is a chance that the United States, in the grips of economic nationalism, might abandon its historic policy of free trade and ignite a new race for economic privilege as well.

Economic–Security Nexus in the AIIB: China's Quest for Security through Eurasian Connectivity.,"Andornino, Giovanni B.",Global Policy,19-Nov,Wiley-Blackwell,INTERNATIONAL security; SOVEREIGNTY; NATIONAL security; INTERNATIONAL relations; CHINA; BEIJING (China); INVESTMENT banking,,"The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) is mainly considered as a commercial connectivity and sustainability‐oriented infrastructure development bank, but there are also international security dimensions to the Bank. China's geostrategic and security motivations are said to be behind its spearheading of the AIIB. This essay highlights that China's national and international security calculations have evolved in the period after the Bank's opening. In the initial phase of the AIIB's formation, 2013–2017, the Bank's creation was part of Beijing's pursuit of a more outwardly ambitious and bold national/international security agenda of new institution‐building, looking to reshape the system of global governance. But since 2017, China's leadership has responded to sustained international pushback against its ambitious agenda, especially but not exclusively from the United States, and it has refocused its national security priorities onto protecting national economic growth, national sovereignty and regime preservation. Beijing has supported moves to put some distance between the AIIB and the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), and Chinese strategists have shifted to seeing the AIIB as helpful for mitigating an economic downturn across Eurasia, and preserving China's continuing growth and regime survival in what they perceive as a period of external threat. Future research on China's conduct inside existing multilateral bodies, and its formation of the AIIB as a new multilateral organization, should assess Beijing's behavior through the theoretical framework of ontological security calculations as well as material power.

education as a source and tool of soft power in international relations.,"wojciuk, anna; michałek, maciej; stormowska, marta",European Political Science,15-Sep,Palgrave Macmillan Ltd.,INTERNATIONAL relations; SOFT power (Social sciences); EDUCATION policy; FINLAND; EDUCATIONAL quality; HIGHER education; HIGHER education -- China; EDUCATION & globalization,,"As the term 'soft power' in international relations (IR) has been coined by Joseph Nye a quarter of a century ago it has gained a great response and initiated numerous debates. A high quality education sector is one of the important factors that contributes to a country's soft power. Despite that, as shown in the article, education has not been adequately covered in the existing IR literature. The article addresses this lacuna by offering an attempt to conceptualise and operationalise the educational aspect of soft power. First, with cases from the People's Republic of China and Finland, it provides various examples of growing internationalisation of education, and analyses possible soft power gains from education. Second, the article provides a theoretical conceptualization of educational soft power, and presents three mechanisms that it can work through: as a carrier of genuine values, as a resource that countries possess, and as a tool in achieving certain goals. All three mechanisms also show how increasing internationalisation brings more direct connections between education, international relations, and foreign policy.

Emerging powers in Africa: Is Brazil any different?,"White, Lyal",South African Journal of International Affairs,13-Apr,Taylor & Francis Ltd,EMERGING markets; ECONOMIC development; INTERNATIONAL relations; CAPITALISTS & financiers; POLITICAL economic analysis; STRATEGIC planning; CONTRACTS; AFRICA; BRAZIL,Africa; Brazil; development; emerging powers,"Africa's economic rise and growing prosperity over the past decade has attracted the attention of investors, development agencies and governments from across the globe. Brazil has joined this charge of established and emerging powers in Africa. Recent activities across the continent and the development of certain bilateral agreements suggest an alternative approach from other emerging powers in Africa, underpinned by development cooperation between Brazilian and African partners in key sectors. The ‘Brazilian way’, building on its positive image in Africa – primarily through development cooperation – while accumulating core commercial and strategic assets, appears to be aiming at sustainable engagement with long-term objectives. The explicit role of business in Brazil's development agenda in Africa sets it apart from traditional European and US counterparts, which have typically relied on donor-led aid and development. However, criticism has also crept in around Brazil's general reluctance to use its influence and commercial leverage to push for greater democratic freedoms in some of the African countries where it operates. While Brazil's commercial interests on the African continent are slightly different from commodity-starved players like India and China, which are explicitly reliant on extractive motives linked to price and efficiency, the question remains, ‘Is Brazil's interest and engagement with Africa any different from the rest?’ [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of South African Journal of International Affairs is the property of Routledge and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission.

Despite being a non-oil exporting country, Ethiopia has become one of the fastest growing economies in Africa and, over the past decade, millions of people have been lifted out of poverty. Part of Ethiopia’s success has been the ability of the developmental state to harness its relationship with the new as well as the traditional development partners strategically, to unleash the country’s productive potential while maintaining national policy space. Ethiopia’s pragmatic ‘economic diplomacy’ arose from the desire of the liberation movements that formed the umbrella Ethiopian People’s Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) to fundamentally transform all aspects of Ethiopian society and to break out of poverty, which the EPRDF considers a ‘national shame’ and a handicap to the country’s ability to define foreign and development policies independently. The Ethiopian experience challenges the school of thought that equates the rise of emerging powers in Africa with a new form of ‘colonialism’, disregarding African agency to transform these relationship into ‘win-win’ partnerships.

Others prefer to use the terms “great powers” or “hegemony.” This research note will, first, try to assess the added value that the concept of empire brings to the study of international relations. The second aim is to establish how best to study contemporary empires. Which actors can be classified as empires? Should one focus on imperial structure, mission or behaviour? The third objective is to seek ways of identifying patterns of cooperation and competition among empires. Can the contemporary manifestations of empire co-exist without major conflict?

The operations of the CCP’s external propaganda system are no longer guided by dogma; rather, these incorporate many Western theories related to “public diplomacy,” which emphasizes the role played by non-governmental actors and the use of a softer approach. However, the CCP’s understanding of the concept of public diplomacy is influenced by the “people’s diplomacy” of the Cold War period. This means that it continues to base its external propaganda on the idea of a struggle against enemies, attempting to establish an international united front with a view to boosting the CCP’s right of discourse in the international arena and weakening anti-China forces in the West.

However, it is also true that the bilateral relations still remain far from satisfaction in terms of depth and degree of communication, crisis management, and a shared vision. Given Korean's psychological alertness and apprehension formed over a long history of contacts with China, differences in political system, mutual misperceptions, and degree of understanding, these problems cast serious challenges for future relations between the two countries. In the future, Korea- China relations could be sour and bumpy if the Korean government relies excessively on security-oriented approaches, centering on its alliance with the U.S. Korea needs to exercise a ""creative middle power-pragmatic diplomacy"" in dealing with China. The objective is to establish a positive-sum game in the Korea-China strategic cooperative partnership, extending consultation and cooperation beyond security issues on the Korean Peninsula. Both the Korea-U.S. alliance and the Korea-China strategic cooperative partnership should be the foundation of Korea's diplomatic assets, under which Korea would try to persuade North Korea to abandon its nuclear program. The substance of Korea-China relations will be determined by the policies of each government to consolidate the ""cooperative strategic partnership."" Sound communication, political will, and strategic management matter. The future relationship of Korea with China is at the crossroad among the ranges of being enemy, homager, or equal partner. Korea obviously favors the establishment of an equal partnership with China, based upon the common principles of mutual respect, cooperation, and co-prosperity.

Energy Security in Central Asia in a Multi-Polar World: An Overview.,"Peimani, Hooman",Orient (00305227),2010,Deutsches Orient-Institut,"ENERGY policy; NATIONAL security; POWER resources; INTERNATIONAL relations & culture; INTERNATIONAL relations; EMERGING markets; CENTRAL Asia; ASIA; SOCIAL aspects; CENTRAL Asian politics & government; ECONOMIC conditions in Central Asia, 1991-",,"Energy security in Central Asia is a complicated objective for its five forming states thanks to the interaction of external and internal factors, which are not confined to the regional countries' energy requirements. Central Asia is an important region for various reasons ranging from its geostrategic location as a country in the proximity of rising (China) and re-rising (Russia) superpowers and regional powers (Iran, India and Pakistan) to its significant fossil energy resources. The latter has made the region a player in the energy security of both Asian (mainly, but not exclusively, China) and Western economies. This role has particularly made the latter interested in the regional affairs resulting in the formation of an energy-foreign/defence policies nexus, which has shaped, to a large extent, the policies of the Asian and European economies towards Central Asia. To this, one should add Russia's bid to return to Central Asia for political, security and economic reasons as well as Iran's and Turkey's efforts to penetrate the region as regional powers with various ties to the Central Asian countries. Added to the external factors, the regional countries' history of mistrust and suspicion of each other and rivalry over supremacy has negatively affected their bilateral and multilateral relations since their independence. Against this background, since fossil energy accounts for the bulk of the regional countries' energy requirements, the region's division into energy-haves (Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan) and have-nots (Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan) has complicated the situation by creating a difficult pattern of energy dependency and cooperation affected heavily by political and security considerations. Briefly, the pursuit of energy security by the Central Asian states has been a factor contributing to inter-state tensions on occasions, although meeting the energy security objectives of non-Central Asian countries (China) has ironically contributed to their cooperation.

Engaging both the Eagle and the Dragon: The Philippines' Precarious and Futile Attempt in Equi-balancing.,"De Castro, Renato Cruz",Pacific Focus,10-Dec,Wiley-Blackwell,"INTERNATIONAL relations; INTERNATIONAL economic assistance; SPRATLY Islands; PHILIPPINES; PHILIPPINES -- Politics & government -- 1986-; PHILIPPINE diplomatic & consular service; ARROYO, Gloria Macapagal, 1947-",,"The article examines the limits and challenges small powers face when they adjust to systemic changes. Specifically, this article discusses the Philippines' conduct of a diplomatic strategy of equi-balancing between the USA and China. In this strategy, the Philippines enhances and deepens its security relations with its strategic ally, the USA and at the same time, obtains economic assistance and politico-diplomatic concessions from East Asia's emergent power, China. The Philippines' diplomatic gambit, however, is restrained by its formal alliance with the USA and its chronic territorial dispute with China over the Spratly Islands. At present, several developments are undermining Manila's efforts in playing this balancing game with Washington and Beijing. These are: the Philippines' passive role in this triangular relation; its status as Washington's formal treaty; its volatile domestic politics; and the tension in Philippine-China relations generated by the two countries' territorial dispute. In conclusion, the article warns that current dynamics in both Philippine-US and Sino-US relations can transform the Philippine role in this triangle from a passive and opportunistic balancer to a pawn, or a spoil, or a perpetual weak/buffer state - a tragic victim of 21st century big power realpolitik.

Apparently, the rise of a nondemocratic, Asian rival to US hegemony potentially undermines the growth of democracy throughout the system. Many see a resource-hungry China engaging itself globally out of purely self-interested motives, and Chinese business and aid offer a viable alternative to Western influence. Using the Stockholm Institute for Peace Research's (SIPRI) data on arms transfers since the end of the Cold War, we test the proposition empirically by assessing the nature and strength of Chinese politico-military support, measured as conventional arms transfers, globally and to African regimes. In short, we find that China relative to the United States transfers greater amounts of arms to democracies rather than autocracies, whereas the United States seems to prefer more autocratic regimes, despite rhetoric that claims an ethical foreign policy. The same result holds when we assess this relationship using human fights data. Moreover, Chinese arms transfers to countries suffering civil wars are much lower than the United States'. The findings are robust to the inclusion of several control variables and alternative estimation techniques. The findings show that popular perceptions about China's role in Africa do not match reality, particularly when assessed against the current hegemon's behavior.

I argue discourses of postcolonial nationalism and global terrorism aligned along domestic, regional, and international political levels to enable a military victory for the government of Sri Lanka. At the domestic political level, there was a change in government along with a split and defection within the LTTE command. At the international level, there was a turn away from Western allies due to their perceived inability to understand the needs of the Asian front in the global war on terror (GWOT). This led to a geopolitical realignment with China, a state sympathetic to fighting terrorism and secession movements. The case is studied under a theoretical lens of “de/re territorialisation” from Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari. De/re territorialisation reveals simultaneous efforts to inscribe nationalist meaning into territory in a constant process of “becoming.” [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Geopolitics is the property of Routledge and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission.

Escalating Tensions in the South China Sea and Asia-Pacific Security.,"Shad, Muhammad Riaz; Ahmed, Sarfraz",Pakistan Horizon,17-Jan,Pakistan Institute of International Affairs,NATIONAL security; PACIFIC Area cooperation; ALLIANCES (International relations); INTERNATIONAL economic relations; SOUTH China Sea; CHINA-United States relations,,"Notwithstanding the extensive US-China economic cooperation, strategic competition between the two in the Asia-Pacific region has intensified since the United States (US)' 'pivot to Asia.' The US increased attention towards Asia-Pacific has led not only to its economic partnership and security alliances with smaller states but also bolstering of military presence in the region. This has prompted Chinese fears of US designs in the region, reinforcing the perception that the latter is seeking containment of China. In this strategic conundrum, the South China Sea (SCS) dispute between China and smaller littoral states has become the centre of tensions between the two major players - China and the US While the US does not have any territorial claim in the SCS, it seeks freedom of navigation and extends vocal support to smaller claimant states. The smaller claimants dispute China's extensive claims in the sea represented by its 'nine-dash line'. In response to the growing US military clout in Asia-Pacific, China has asserted itself through construction of artificial islands and expansion of military activity in the SCS. This study spells out the claims of the littoral states and highlights the US-China colliding economic and strategic interests in the SCS. This is followed by an analysis of the US-China competing strategies to pursue their interests in the SCS and prospects for any future conflict in Asia-Pacific. The study postulates that the mutually exclusive stances taken by China and the US and their competing power projections vis-a-vis the SCS carry the risk of potential war in Asia-Pacific.

Escalation through Entanglement: How the Vulnerability of Command-and-Control Systems Raises the Risks of an Inadvertent Nuclear War.,"Acton, James M.",International Security,Summer2018,MIT Press,"NUCLEAR weapons; NATIONAL security; INTERNATIONAL relations; ISLAMIC State (Organization); TRUMP, Donald, 1946-",,"Nonnuclear weapons are increasingly able to threaten dual-use command, control, communication, and intelligence assets that are spaced based or distant from probable theaters of conflict. This form of “entanglement” between nuclear and nonnuclear capabilities creates the potential for Chinese or Russian nonnuclear strikes against the United States or U.S. strikes against either China or Russia to spark inadvertent nuclear escalation. Escalation pressures could be generated through crisis instability or through one of two newly identified mechanisms: “misinterpreted warning” or the “damage-limitation window.” The vulnerability of dual-use U.S. early-warning assets provides a concrete demonstration of the risks. These risks would be serious for two reasons. First, in a conventional conflict against the United States, China or Russia would have strong incentives to launch kinetic strikes on U.S. early-warning assets. Second, even limited strikes could undermine the United States' ability to monitor nuclear attacks by the adversary. Moreover, cyber interference with dual-use early-warning assets would create the additional danger of the target's misinterpreting cyber espionage as a destructive attack. Today, the only feasible starting point for efforts to reduce the escalation risks created by entanglement would be unilateral measures—in particular, organizational reform to ensure that those risks received adequate consideration in war planning, acquisition decisions, and crisis decisionmaking. Over the longer term, unilateral measures might pave the way for more challenging cooperative measures, such as agreed restrictions on threatening behavior.

EU Global Strategy in a changing world: Brussels’ approach to the emerging powers.,"Howorth, Jolyon",Contemporary Security Policy,16-Dec,Taylor & Francis Ltd,INTERNATIONAL relations; AUTONOMY & independence movements; GOVERNMENT policy; REGULATORY impact analysis; EUROPEAN Union,BRICs; China; emerging powers; EU Global Strategy; European Union,"The world is entering a period of power transition, at the outcome of which some new form of global order (or disorder) is likely to emerge. Critical to this process is the interaction between the established powers, the USA and the European Union (EU), and the emerging powers, particularly China, Brazil, India and Russia. Many analysts have classified the EU as a declining power, a perception that has been enhanced with the triple crises of sovereignty that have rocked the Union since the mid-2000s (money, borders and defence). In this context, the publication of the EU Global Strategy was an opportunity for the EU to state clearly the nature of its ongoing and future relations with the rest of the world. This article argues that, in reality, Europe as a bloc (as opposed to its member states severally) has very limited purchase with the other major powers, and an ambivalent or ill-defined grasp of how to engage with them. They, for their part, have difficulty in knowing how to understand the EU as an actor and prefer to deal bilaterally with its key member states.

EU-China Collaboration in the Reform of the International Monetary System: Much Ado About Nothing?,"Otero‐Iglesias, Miguel; Zhang, Ming",World Economy,14-Jan,Wiley-Blackwell,"INTERNATIONAL relations; INTERNATIONAL finance; BALANCE of payments; CHINA; EUROPEAN Union; GLOBAL Financial Crisis, 2008-2009; UNITED States; LIQUIDITY (Economics)",,"The global financial crisis has shown that the current international monetary system ( IMS) suffers from an inherent flaw: it depends on US current account deficits for the provision of global liquidity. Under this arrangement, peripheral countries have to accept periodically the debasement of the US dollar. Thus, there are some mutual incentives for the EU and China to reform the current IMS through cooperation. Both are in favour of stable exchange rates, and both are keen to constrain US macroeconomic profligacy. There have been some efforts towards these objectives in the past, especially during the French presidency of the G20 in 2011. However, there has been no significant progress. On the European side, there is not a united and independent Europe which could act as the primary agent of reform. On the Chinese side, Beijing does not see Europe as a reliable partner because the latter is deemed to have a major vested interest in the current regime. As a result, the French government failed to focus the world's attention on the reform of the IMS during G20 Cannes Summit, and the Chinese government has chosen a more unilateral way to internationalise its own currency.

Europe - Still between the Superpowers.,"Cox, Michael",Global Policy,Jun2017 Supplement 4,Wiley-Blackwell,PEACE -- International cooperation; INTERNATIONAL economic assistance -- Government policy; INTERNATIONAL relations; ECONOMIC policy; ECONOMICS; EUROPE; UNITED States -- Foreign economic relations,,"In a famous study published in 1978, the American diplomat Anton DePorte argued - controversially - that a Europe held in frozen check between the superpowers was the only sound basis upon which the continent could find peace. The ending of the bloc system in Europe between 1989 and 1991 put paid to this dystopian vision. Indeed, within only a few years, many writers were even beginning to suggest that the new united Europe might one day become a superpower in its own right. As we now know, this early wave of unbridled optimism has given way to an altogether more downbeat mood. In this article, it shall be argued that the prevalent pessimism about Europe is not just a function of what has been occurring within Europe itself. It is also a reflection of the fact that the international order, which during the 1990s seemed to be so benign, has become much less so over the past 15 years. A close examination of Europe's relationships with the three great powers the United States, China and Russia indeed suggests that the world is likely to become more, rather than less, difficult for Europe as it moves forward into the 21st century. Testing times lie ahead.

"Europe and China's sea disputes: between normative politics, power balancing and acquiescence.","Cottey, Andrew",European Security,19-Dec,Taylor & Francis Ltd,BALANCE of power; INTERNATIONAL relations; CHINA; EUROPEAN Union; SEXUAL consent; EAST Asians; SOUTH Asians; SEAS,China; East China Sea; EU foreign policy; European foreign policy; normative power; South China Sea,"China's disputes with its South East Asian neighbours and Japan in the South and East China Seas have emerged as important tests of the implications of China's rise, posing dilemmas not just for regional states but also for other global actors, including European states and the European Union (EU). European responses to these disputes have pulled in three directions: a normative approach emphasising the resolution of disputes within the framework of international law; a power balancing approach, led by France and the United Kingdom, involving support for freedom of navigation operations and strengthened bilateral and EU ties with other Asian states; and de facto acquiescence to Chinese advances in the region. In terms of understanding EU foreign policy, this case suggests a sequence: a normative approach as the initial default EU policy; a turn to power balancing when the effectiveness of that policy is called into question, but also the possibility of acquiescence and consequent divisions amongst EU member states. Europe faces dilemmas in balancing support for the United States, Japan and the South-East Asian states with its strategic partnership with China, but in practice European policy is much closer to that of the former group than that of Beijing.

(Institute of International Relations)",ECONOMIC development; CRISIS management; INTERNATIONAL relations; ELITE (Social sciences); EUROPE; CHINA; EUROPEAN Union,China; EU; normative power; sovereign debt crisis,"Europe in the form of the European Union is seen in China as a major player in global affairs. As a sui generis actor, the EU was seen in general as a progressive force in world affairs in China. Europe's economic might and normative appeals were also widely acknowledged in China, even though the Chinese on occasions complained of the assertive normative diplomacy of the EU and its member states, which was backed by its economic power. However, as Europe encounters a severe sovereign debt crisis, and China continues its fast growth in terms of economic development and international influence, the Chinese leaders, elites and general public are starting to develop a more realistic view of Europe and scaling down some of their wishful thinking about the ever-growing influence of the EU. Yet, at government level, relations with the EU and its member states are still on the top of China's foreign policy agenda. By trying to offer a helping hand to the EU, the Chinese government is hoping that the current crisis might turn into a stimulating factor for a closer relationship between China and the EU/member states on both bilateral and global issues.

These partnerships reflect the emergence of an actor that seeks to establish foreign policy goals with an attendant institutional architecture and political commitment. This paper examines two of these partnerships with the United States and China to illustrate the manner in which the EU has constructed a collective identity for itself via discursive association with great power states, while claiming a normative character as an actor of a different kind, with the ability to act strategically with great power states via temporal and ethical forms of social distancing from these same actors. This paper consults recent survey research and policy developments to assess the success of these EU discursive strategies. It is concluded that these partnerships play a somewhat useful role in establishing the EU as an actor of global significance, whilst the EU is less successful in its inherent claims of normative superiority.

Evolving Bureaucratic Politics in Chinese Foreign Policy-Making.,Zhang Qingmin,Korean Journal of Defense Analysis,15-Dec,Korea Institute for Defense Analyses,BUREAUCRACY; FACTIONALISM (Politics); INTERNATIONAL relations; DEMOCRACY; CHINA -- Foreign relations; CHINA,bureaucratic politics; Chinese foreign policy; factionalism; government politics,"Growing economically more powerful and confident, China is exerting unprecedented influence on global affairs. But the diverse voices and sometimes inconsistencies in its foreign policy behavior have confused many China watchers. Such phenomena demonstrate some new trends in Chinese foreign policy. In order to unveil such trends, this paper intends to look at Chinese foreign policy practices by employing the theoretical framework of bureaucratic politics. Its conclusion is that the foreign policy-making process of the People's Republic of China (PRC) has progressed from the ideology based in-party factionalism of ""line battles"" to interest-based government politics of organizational competition. The early stage has distinctive Chinese characteristics, which are different from Western bureaucratic politics. But as Chinese society becomes more diversified, the bureaucratic politics in China begins to share more similarities with those in the Western democracies. Such trends render the application of Foreign Policy Analysis (FPA) to the research of Chinese foreign policymaking both necessary and beneficial to the construction of theories of foreign policy analysis, as well as research on China's foreign policy itself.

Recent years have seen Manila dramatically oscillating between the extremes of engagement and deterrence toward China, and dependence on, and independence from, the United States. In particular, while the Benigno Aquino III administration (2010-2016) adopted soft counterbalancing against China and heavily relied on American military support, the succeeding Rodrigo Duterte administration, in contrast, distanced itself from America in favor of deeper engagement with China. The seemingly erratic swings in the pendulum of Manila's foreign policy is a telltale sign of the dilemma of small power politics as well as the tempestuous nature of Philippine domestic politics.

However, the geostrategic landscape changed dramatically since the unfortunate incidents of 9/11 and US deflection towards Afghanistan, Iraq and changes taking place around wider Middle East as a result of Arab Spring. The events following US led war on terrorism provided space to fast pace economic development of China what is generally referred as China’s peaceful rise. Secondly, Russian resurgence and rise of regional economic blocks like BRICS, European Union (EU) and ASEAN which represent the larger blocks on the globe suggest that uni-polarity does not have the stamina to sustain itself any longer and the world is fast moving towards multi-polarity and era of economic integration, interdependence and common development. The evolving strategic milieu brings enormous opportunities for Pakistan as rising powers and economic blocks are favorably poised towards Pakistan. However, it is preconditioned on the premise of correct positioning and right type of foreign policy choices made through proactive planning and active diplomacy. This research article explores the validity of notion of declining uni-polarity by analyzing the reshaping of geo-strategic construct and suggesting viable foreign policy priorities for Pakistan to accrue maximum dividends from the evolving landscape.

This question is particularly important in the context of a rising China and its relations with the United States. While China's perception of the United States can be examined from many angles, this study focuses on Chinese official media perception by analyzing U.S.-related articles in the People's Daily from 2000 to 2010. Our data indicate that the People's Daily's overall attention to the United States declined while the overall image of the United States moved toward the positive direction. When breaking down the overall image by issue areas or dimensions, we find that the United States was primarily perceived negatively in the areas of political-ideological issues, military-strategic issues, and U.S. role in world affairs, whereas in the economic-trade and other issue areas, a favorable image of the United States appeared to be expanded. Key implications for U.S.-China relations are discussed in the conclusion.

The reshaping of the international order--with China pushing for a more hierarchical view of international relations, and the administration of Donald Trump repositioning the USA in global politics--provides Canada with the impetus to rediscover the traditional role that middle powers played as reliable middle managers for the global project. Today, such ""middle management"" is deprived of a reliable role. Since China has yet to articulate a coherent normative vision of a new global order, and the USA is retreating to a purely transactional view of trade and diplomacy, Canada and other middle powers have few choices other than to try to adapt to the changes in the hopes of sustaining the normative mesh that has upheld the post-war order.

As an organization of small and middle powers, ASEAN faces strategic uncertainties brought about by the power transition in the system. Deepening economic interdependence between ASEAN and China has amplified the economic cost for the ASEAN states to use traditional military means to deal with China's rise. Applying institutional balancing theory, this paper examines how ASEAN has adopted various institutional instruments, such as the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF), the East Asia Summit (EAS), the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), and the ASEAN Community, to constrain and shape China's behaviour in the region in the post-Cold War era. It argues that due to globalization and economic interdependence, the power transition in the 21st century is different from the previous ones. ASEAN can potentially make a great contribution to a peaceful transformation of the international system. How to resolve the South China Sea disputes peacefully will be a critical task for both the ASEAN and Chinese leaders in the next decade or two.

This occurred as a consequence of the politicization of international business relations that came about when other great powers began increasingly to challenge Britain's global commercial, political, and imperial supremacy. Britain had traditionally followed a laissez-faire line when it came to supporting or protecting British overseas business enterprise. In the mid-1880s, Britain was compelled to review its policy. After this, the British government was prepared to offer limited assistance to British firms, but this often took place only in regions which were significant in terms of overall policy interest, including Turkey, Iran, and China. This article examines British commercial diplomacy in the Balkans, a region which has not received much attention from historians in this framework. British commercial diplomacy there followed the general line of limited intervention and support was offered mostly on legal grounds. Local political troubles and great power politics also played a role in diplomatic decision-making as did negative cultural perceptions, but to a considerably lesser degree. In most cases, the British government refrained from supporting British business enterprise in the Balkans on account of fears about financial speculation.

This article seeks to explore the impacts of increased Chinese engagement with Africa on governance through a comparative case study of two contrasting cases: Sudan and Zambia, using the concept of flexigemony. Contrary to popular perception, behaviour by Chinese actors has sometimes been a moderating force in Sudan, while provoking violence in Zambia.

First, little is known about how two sets of dualistic conceptual entities may be connected in the often-contentious state formation process between: (1) the ruling minority and ruled majority; and (2) the nationalising state and grain-producing frontiers. Second, very little is known about the role that the Chinese business networks played and how they contributed to the state formation processes. Using a Philippine trans-local grain-trading network as a site of investigation, the paper seeks to fill these knowledge gaps by delineating an integrative approach – designated as rhizomatic political economy – which argues that Southeast Asian state formation may hinge on the instrumentalisation of Chinese business networks and what is identified as their rhizomatic power/knowledge system. They are not just business-brokers in the trans-local grain trade that connects the national capital and grain-producing locales, but also serve as political brokers to implement state measures in regards to food and interior security affairs.

We argue that documenting aid-like activities in earlier historical periods helps shed new light on the systemic political dynamics of aid giving. We introduce a framework that links aid giving to the status quo in international politics and populate the framework with a diverse set of historical and contemporary cases, including Western and non-Western donors. Our analysis reveals striking similarities between the ways in which donor governments from diverse regions, historical periods, and international systems have utilised aid and other forms of concessional finance to pursue international political goals. Our findings suggest that by considering the pre-Marshall Plan roots of aid researchers can more effectively link foreign aid provision to rising power dynamics, international formal and informal hierarchies, and other research agendas in international relations. Our analysis also points to the need for greater attention to non-Western and pre-World War II evidence in understanding the link between aid and systems of international relations that have been less prevalent in the post-Marshall Plan era.

Foreign Policy Convergence in Pacific Asia: The Evidence from Voting in the UN General Assembly.,"Ferdinand, Peter",British Journal of Politics & International Relations,14-Nov,Sage Publications Inc.,INTERNATIONAL relations; GOVERNMENT policy; VOTING; ASEAN; EUROPEAN Union; ASIA -- Foreign relations,Pacific Asia; United Nations General Assembly; Voting cohesion indexes,"Research Highlights and Abstract Research Highlights Comparative assessment of three indexes of voting cohesion, Demonstrates the strong shared orientation towards global affairs among states in the Pacific Asian region, especially ASEAN and China, which is greater than that of the EU, Shows the widespread reluctance of most Pacific Asian states publicly to criticize human rights abuses, Shows the estrangement of the US from the foreign policy orientations of Pacific Asian states, even Japan and South Korea, This article aims to do three things: (i) compare three different indexes for assessing the voting cohesion of regional groups of states in the UN General Assembly; (ii) use these indexes to assess the foreign policy convergence of states in Pacific Asia on global issues between 1974 and 2008; (iii) compare the extent of that convergence with the European Union ( EU). All three indexes show a high degree of convergence in the voting records of states in Pacific Asia, but particularly in ASEAN, which is higher than in the EU. The most frequent cause of divergence since the end of the Cold War has been the reluctance of most states in the region, apart from Japan and South Korea, publicly to criticize the human rights records of other states. Although there are variations, the results also reveal the divergence in voting between states throughout the region and the US.

Foreign Policy Implications of Chinese Nationalism Revisited: the strident turn.,"Zhao, Suisheng",Journal of Contemporary China,13-Jul,Taylor & Francis Ltd,NATIONALISM; COMMUNISM; PUBLIC opinion; INTERNATIONAL relations; ANTI-Japanism; TERRITORIAL waters; GREAT powers (International relations); NATIONAL interest; SOUTH China Sea; CHINA; CHINA -- Foreign relations -- 21st century; WESTERN countries; ATTITUDE (Psychology); CHINA-Japan relations; CHINESE,,"This paper revisits the debate about foreign policy implications of Chinese nationalism in the context of China's increasingly confrontational and assertive behavior in recent years. It argues that while the Chinese government made effective efforts to control popular nationalism and Chinese foreign policy was therefore not dictated by emotional nationalistic rhetoric before 2008, it has become more willing to follow the popular nationalist calls to take a confrontational position against the Western powers and to adopt tougher measures in maritime territorial disputes with its neighbors. This strident turn is partially because the government is increasingly responsive to public opinion, but more importantly because of the convergence of Chinese state nationalism and popular nationalism calling for a more muscular Chinese foreign policy. Enjoying an inflated sense of empowerment supported by its new quotient of wealth and military capacities, and terrified of an uncertain future due to increasing social, economic and political tensions at home, the communist state has become more willing to play to the popular nationalist gallery in pursuing the so-called core national interests. These developments have complicated China's diplomacy, creating a heated political environment to harden China's foreign policy.

"Foreign policy think tanks in China and Japan: Characteristics, current profile, and the case of collective self-defence.","Abb, Pascal; Koellner, Patrick",International Journal,15-Dec,Sage Publications Inc.,INTERNATIONAL relations; RESEARCH institutes; NATIONAL security; CHINA; JAPAN; SELF-defense,bilateral relations; China; collective self-defence; Foreign policy; Japan; think tanks,"The role of foreign policy think tanks (FPTTs) in policy-making has received substantial scholarly attention, with most studies focusing on US-based organizations. In this article, we seek to address this spatial bias by discussing the development and roles of FPTTs in two East Asian countries, China and Japan. China today hosts the second-largest think tank scene in the world, and many FPTTs have received influxes of funding and increased the academic qualifications of their staffers in recent years. Japan also hosts a sizable array of think tanks, but many of them operate on a for-profit basis and do not focus on public policy issues; Japan has very few genuine FPTTs. In both countries, FPTTs are in many ways linked to the government. While they seek to inform and influence foreign and security policy as well as public discourse on international affairs, they usually do not act as agenda setters. By examining the recent case of constitutional reinterpretation in Japan, which aimed to enable collective self-defence, we show how Japanese public intellectuals, including think tankers, helped to legitimize this controversial move and how Chinese FPTTs reacted publicly by providing media commentary in support of the official government line.

From Financial Assets to Financial Statecraft: the case of China and emerging economies of Africa and Latin America.,"Wu, Friedrich; De Wei, Koh",Journal of Contemporary China,14-Sep,Taylor & Francis Ltd,INTERNATIONAL relations; HISTORY of diplomacy; PETROLEUM industry & politics; ECONOMICS; CHINA -- Foreign economic relations; AFRICA-China relations; LATIN America -- Foreign relations -- 1980-; CHINA-Taiwan relations; TWENTY-first century,,"Over the past few decades, China has accumulated over US$3.4 trillion of official foreign exchange reserves as it rises to become a global power. Do China's financial assets increase its ability to pursue its national interests internationally? With the globalisation and rising influence of Chinese state-owned enterprises, state-owned banks and sovereign wealth fund, as well as China's growing clout in several regional groupings, it is clear that China does possess the necessary mechanisms to assert its financial power. This article examines the efficacy and limitations of these mechanisms in Africa and Latin America, in the economic and political domains. In the economic domain, China has consistently used foreign oil contracts and acquisitions to secure direct oil flow from developing nations. An analysis of recent cases shows that while China is able to successfully harness its financial power in its pursuit of oil, it needs to fulfil its promises to the satisfaction of the recipient countries in order to maintain the value of its offers. In the political domain, China has used its financial assets to purchase diplomatic allegiance from various African and Latin American countries in support of its One-China policy. Studying both successful and unsuccessful cases reveals that while China is generally able to use its financial power in third-world countries against Taiwan successfully, its national goals have, in recent years, shifted to the economic realm, even with countries that still recognise the Taipei government.

From Keeping a Low Profile to Striving for Achievement.,"Yan, Xuetong",Chinese Journal of International Politics,14-Jun,Oxford University Press / USA,INTERNATIONAL relations; MORAL realism; LEGITIMACY of governments; WORLD politics; CHINA -- Foreign relations,,"Since 2012, some scholars, both Chinese and foreign, have argued that China's assertive foreign policy is doomed to fail. Nevertheless, after examining China's foreign relations in the last two years, this paper finds that China has experienced improved relations rather than deteriorating ones. In comparison with the strategy of keeping a low profile (KLP), the strategy of striving for achievement (SFA) shows more efficiency in shaping a favorable environment for China's national rejuvenation. The author applies the theory of moral realism to explaining the role of the SFA strategy and argues that morality can increase both international political strength and the political legitimacy of a rising power. The key difference between the KLP and the SFA is that the former focuses on economic gains and the latter seeks to strengthen political support. That is the reason that the SFA values the role of morality and the KLP does not. Due to these different goals, the SFA strategy differs from the KLP strategy in aspects of tenets, general layouts, working approaches, and methods. So far, the SFA has achieved progress beyond people's expectation from Xi Jinping in 2012. Xi's strong leadership may become a new case suitable for illustrating the theory of moral realism.

Thus, rather than considering the IIR as an organization subject to a political party, it should be regarded as an institution charged with gathering scholars to defend the country.

Generation Matters: Taiwan’s Perceptions of Mainland China and Attitudes Towards Cross-Strait Trade Talks.,"Liu, Frank C.-S.; Li, Yitan",Journal of Contemporary China,17-Mar,Taylor & Francis Ltd,STUDENT activism; VOTERS -- Attitudes; INTERNATIONAL economic relations; TAIWAN; CHINA-Taiwan relations; CHINA -- Foreign economic relations; TAIWAN -- Politics & government,,"It has been widely assumed that perceptions about mutual relationships positively influence attitudes toward trade talks. The Sunflower Movement in Taiwan that took place in the spring of 2014 seemed to create an empirical puzzle, leading observers to believe that Taiwan’s younger generations hold conservative attitudes about trade talks with Mainland China. This study, based on an analysis of representative data collected before the movement, suggests that younger generations in Taiwan are hostile to Mainland China politically but support trade talks. In summary, the authors find that family orientation, national/ethnic identification, state/country identification, belief in Taiwan’s democratic impact, and generation serve as critical factors in the formation of positive attitudes toward trade talks. These findings contribute to the literature by providing a deeper insight into the dynamics of the Sunflower Movement and updating the political orientation profile of Taiwanese voters.

This has also been reflected in 2016 presidential campaign debate on the SCS as an emerging area of U.S. foreign and national security policy concern. The East China Sea (ECS) is at least as important for the strategic interests of the U.S. and its allies given the tension between China and Japan over the Senkaku/Diaoyu islands, potential energy resources in this body of water, increasing defense spending by adjacent geographic powers, the area's importance as a maritime international trade route, and the possibility that communication failures and miscalculation by interested powers could result in military conflict. This work will examine the historical background of this conflict, international legal issues and claims, public opinion within China and Japan, the response of U.S. presidential administrations to this conflict, and how the U.S. Congress has examined it and sought to influence U.S. diplomatic and military responses to this event, and includes recommendations for U.S. and allied military action against China if war occurs. It concludes by making recommendations for the U.S. to maintain candid communications with China, support its strategic interests and those of our allies against Chinese assertiveness, and how to justify an assertive geopolitical stance to domestic and international opinion.

"Geopolitics, Ethnic Conflicts along the Border, and Chinese Foreign Policy Changes toward Myanmar.","Han, Enze",Asian Security,Jan-Apr2017,Taylor & Francis Ltd,ETHNIC conflict; INTERNATIONAL relations; BURMA -- Foreign relations,,"Ever since Myanmar reoriented its foreign policy as a result of its transition to democratic rule in 2010, it has significantly improved its relations with the West, particularly the United States. Amid heightened geostrategic competition between the U.S. and China, how can we understand the Chinese government’s changing approaches to Myanmar, where China’s strategic and economic interests face unprecedented pressure? This article examines those changes in the context of the Chinese government’s response to three militarized ethnic conflicts along its border with Myanmar before and after Myanmar’s foreign policy reorientation. Drawing evidence from Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs statements and Chinese media coverage of the 2009 and 2015 Kokang conflicts and the 2011-2013 Kachin conflict, the article argues that combined geopolitical changes and domestic nationalist signaling explain the variations of China’s foreign policy approaches to Myanmar. The article thus contributes to ongoing interest in China’s foreign policy approaches to Southeast Asia in the wake of geostrategic competition between China and the United States.

Acronyms such as brics (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa), ibsa (India, Brazil and South Africa), and basic (Brazil, South Africa, India and China) abound. This proliferation of groupings signals a repositioning within global governance and their names serve as metaphors for adjustments among formal and informal modes of global governance. They may be understood in terms of global bricolage: a framework for analysing incipient assemblages in global governance. Rooted in cultural political economy, this notion offers a language for grasping a loose meshwork of groupings based on certain large countries in the global South. The concept of global bricolage deepens analysis of polycentric governance and enables observers to identify three major tensions that mark contemporary global order. The antinomies are between old and new narratives that represent actual or potential shifts in prevailing forms of global governance, between an emancipatory spirit and contested neoliberal norms, and between interregional coalitions and intraregional differences. Quite clearly, the manner of addressing them will bear greatly on the shape of future world order.

Global energy governance: do the BRICs have the energy to drive reform?,"DOWNIE, CHRISTIAN",International Affairs,15-Jul,Oxford University Press / USA,ENERGY policy; ENERGY consumption; ENERGY development; INTERNATIONAL relations; BRICS countries; GROUP of Twenty countries; CHINA -- Foreign economic relations; INDIA -- Foreign economic relations,,"It is widely accepted that the rising power of the BRIC countries-Brazil, Russia, India and China-has the potential to re-shape the international system. However, little attention has been given to the BRICs' role in a growing area of strategic importance: global energy governance. While global governance scholars now argue that the international energy architecture requires substantive reform to keep pace with the rapid transformations in global energy markets, largely driven by the BRICs, it is not clear what role these countries will play in future governance arrangements. Drawing on recent scholarship in global governance and international negotiations, interviews with G20 energy officials, and the observations of the author, a past delegate to G20 negotiations, this article examines whether the BRICs as a coalition have the capacity and willingness to drive substantive global energy governance reform. In doing so, it highlights the problems with the BRICs as a coalition on energy and considers the prospects for energy reform in light of China's increasing engagement with energy governance ahead of it hosting the G20 Summit in 2016.

It employs a simplified stock-flow analytical framework to examine the proposition that the pace and pattern of global growth is conditioned by 'under-consumption' in some regions of the world and 'over-borrowing' in other regions. A baseline projection using the Cambridge-Alphametrics model (CAM) illustrates consequences of resumed global imbalances after the 2008-2009 crisis. An alternative scenario exemplifies the case in which China and India shift towards internal income redistribution and domestic demand-orientated policies and suggests that this will not be sufficient to correct global imbalances or induce improved growth rates in other developing regions. Finally a more ambitious development perspective is simulated. Such a scenario requires internationally-coordinated policy efforts, with a greater role for governments in the management of demand, income distribution and environmental sustainability, as well as measures to reduce instability of exchange rate and commodity markets.

We argue that existing theories find it difficult to explain important aspects of this variation in behaviour and we offer instead a framework consisting of three explanatory variables: degree of ‘fit’ between global norms and dominant domestic-level norms; actor perceptions of procedural and substantive legitimacy; and actor perceptions of consequences for the global power hierarchy. We argue that the relative importance of these variables is contingent on the level of domestic salience of the issue area. When salience is high, the degree of normative fit is the primary driver of behavioural consistency; when salience is low, degree of fit becomes less important and the other two variables play a more powerful role in driving behavioural outcomes. We demonstrate how this framework helps to account for the behaviour of the two most important states in the global system, China and the United States, in five areas of central importance to the contemporary global order: the limited use of force, macroeconomic policy surveillance, the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, climate protection and financial regulation. Our argument also explains why globalization may reduce rather than increase levels of behavioural consistency with global norms.

Regardless of the future relationship of the two trade pacts, Taiwan does not have the luxury of picking and choosing. Given its domestic entrenched political cleavages and very challenging geo-strategic and geo-economic environments it faces, Taiwan should pursue membership in both blocs. Indeed, pursuing one can help its bid for the other. Should Taiwan be excluded from both, its economy would not be doomed, as there are still some unrealized trade benefits to exploit. However, a Taiwan not able to join the two clubs would have to absorb psychological and real impacts. Whether as an outsider or insider of the two trade blocs, Taiwan will have to go through industrial upgrading in a big way.

Globalization and the Quest for a ‘Smart’ Foreign Policy.,"Ivanov, Igor",Chinese Journal of International Politics,13-Mar,Oxford University Press / USA,INTERNATIONAL relations; GLOBALIZATION; GOVERNMENT policy; NONGOVERNMENTAL organizations; INTERNATIONAL agencies,,"Globalization continues to be a growing trend from the economy, security, and even the individual as ideas are rapidly exchanged between different cultures. State-actors, although still a critical component, are competing for influence with the private sector, transnational movements, international media, and even small NGOs. In this globalized world nations must adopt the concept of ‘smart’ foreign policy. The basic idea of ‘smart’ foreign policy is outlined in nine major points: focusing on the long term rather than short term opportunistic gains; separating domestic from foreign policy agendas; credibility; global intellectual leadership; enhancing the bureaucratic decision-making process to include all actors in the new globalized world; working more closely with the academic community; harmonizing public and private instruments of foreign policymaking; better educating societies on the concept and benefits of globalization; and finally, enhancing communication among all nations. These nine components of ‘smart’ foreign policy will help facilitate a better world where new opportunities can be discovered and greater progress can be made without the alienation of one group or nation.

Our study suggests that the Chinese model of international development will continue to be one in which temporary one-off projects are favoured; and, insofar as social organisations will play a role, they will be in the domain of government-organised NGOs rather than grassroots NGOs.

Initially it was enthusiastically promoted by a select number of countries in Africa, as well as by key members within the G-8. The European Union was active in its support, particularly vis-a-vis governance issues, stating that the EU 'finds that Africa's development efforts are best served by a greatly sharpened focus on NEPAD as the basis for partnership between Africa and the international community'. However, there have been significant problems facing NEPAD. These revolve around the actual extant political economy and dominant political cultures across Africa, which the technocratic neoliberal agenda of 'good governance' cannot deal with. Furthermore, the rise of Chinese engagement with Africa adds a major difficulty to Brussels' claim to be a key engine in supporting NEPAD's goals regarding governance and development. Indeed, the emergence of Chinese actors in Africa threatens to make much of the EU's policies on governance largely irrelevant, although it is acknowledged that, in the long term, Beijing's policy interests are not served by chaotically ruled states.

Governing the World: China’s Evolving Conceptions of Responsibility.,"Yeophantong, Pichamon",Chinese Journal of International Politics,13-Dec,Oxford University Press / USA,INTERNATIONAL relations; POWER (Social sciences); WORLD politics; CHINA -- Politics & government; CHINA -- Foreign relations,,"This article examines, from an historical perspective, how the idea of the ‘responsibility of power’ speaks to Chinese political thought, and assesses its significance to China’s evolving engagement with global governance today. It argues that a shift in China’s global mentality is now underway: from an aversion to taking the lead to one which sees China reprising its role as a global power and shouldering the responsibilities attached to this status in the management of world affairs. But, contrary to conventional depictions of China’s ‘responsible power’ identity as an externally imposed or purely modern construct, the article illustrates how notions of responsibility and the corollary concept of responsible governance are not new, but have deep roots in Chinese traditions of statecraft and corresponding visions of world order. Taking into account the complex interplay between Chinese conceptions of responsibility and expectations of its global role, change is necessarily situated amidst historical continuity, as linkages are drawn between China’s past and its present.

GREAT POWER CONFLICT: Will It Return?,"Colucci, Lamont",World Affairs,Jan/Feb2015,Sage Publications Inc.,"INTERNATIONAL relations; BALANCE of power; WORLD War I; RUSSIA -- Politics & government -- 1991-; CHINA -- Politics & government; JAPAN -- Politics & government; PUTIN, Vladimir Vladimirovich, 1952-; ABE, Shinzo, 1954-",,"The article discusses international conflict in the 21st century. According to the author, the world may see a renewal of the kind of great power conflicts which led to World Wars I and II. It is suggested that several factors are leading to this resurgence, including multipolarity, the U.S.'s disengagement from its dominant role, and changes in the grand strategies of Russia, China, India, and Japan. It is suggested that these countries are engaging in aggressive and militaristic behavior which has historical parallels in Germany, France, and Great Britain during the 19th century. Other topics include Russian President Vladimir Putin, national security measures in Japan, and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe."

India and China both aspiring for change in their global status positioning, practicing policy of non-interference are having high-stakes in Afghanistan. Although economically engaged both have high considerations for Afghanistan. International community is looking for new stakeholders to assume more responsible role in Afghanistan, how China and India deal with such pressure and foreign policy principles will determine their power status in international system. This paper seeks to locate Afghanistan in India and China's domestic and foreign policy. China's security reason and its commercial engagement with Afghanistan and India's bridge to access and Connect Central Asia policy pave the way towards such understanding. Management of their mutual relation is very crucial for peace in Afghanistan as well as for the entire region.

"Great Power Rivalries, Domestic Politics and Southeast Asian Foreign Policy: Exploring the Linkages.","Murphy, Ann Marie",Asian Security,Sep-Dec2017,Taylor & Francis Ltd,INTERNATIONAL relations; DEMOCRACY; HUMAN rights,,"Southeast Asian states increasingly face a strategic environment characterized by rising Sino-American tensions at the same time that domestic factors are increasingly influencing foreign policy. In recent decades, Southeast Asian states have sought to maintain their strategic autonomy by adopting hedging strategies to secure economic and security benefits from different partners. Since hedging is a rational response to strategic uncertainty, one would predict that as China’s assertiveness in the South China Sea has made clear its intentions to revise the status quo in ways that directly threaten the national interests of the Philippines Vietnam, Malaysia, and Indonesia, that they would begin to balance against China, in part by improving ties with Washington. In contrast to these predictions, no Southeast Asian country is balancing against China today, partly because of the economic incentives offered by China and partly because of the disincentives created by US pressure on democracy and human rights. In the Philippines, Duterte’s strategic re-orientation away from the United States toward China was triggered partly by US condemnation of his bloody war on drugs while US criticism of Thailand’s military coup has weakened the alliance. The unprecedented role of public pressure, interest groups and legislatures is forcing Southeast Asian leaders to publically debate policy decisions long made in private. Public opinion in Southeast Asia has often been anti-American but anti-Chinese sentiment is rising. As domestic and foreign policy becomes increasingly intertwined, Southeast Asian foreign policy is likely to continue to deviate from structurally based alignment predictions and become more erratic.

Grounds for War.,"Johnson, Dominic D. P.; Toft, Monica Duffy",International Security,Winter 2013/14,MIT Press,INTERNATIONAL relations; NATURAL resources; WORLD politics; HUMAN territoriality; GAME theory in biology,,"In international relations, unlike the natural sciences, there are few fundamental principles or laws. The world map, however, reveals at least one iron law of global politics: human territoriality. Almost every inch of the globe is partitioned into exclusive and bounded spaces that ""belong"" to specific groups of humans. Any that is not-such as Kashmir, Jerusalem, and the South China Sea-remains hotly contested. Throughout history, territory has led to recurrent and severe conflict. States are prepared to go to war, and individuals are prepared to die, even over land with little intrinsic value. While such behavior presents a puzzle for international relations theory, a broader evolutionary perspective reveals that territorial behavior has the following three characteristics: (1) it is common across the animal kingdom, suggesting a convergent solution to a common strategic problem; (2) it is a dominant strategy in the ""hawk-dove"" game of evolutionary game theory (under certain well-defined conditions); and (3) it follows a strategic logic, but one calibrated to cost-benefit ratios that prevailed in our evolutionary past, not those of the present. These insights generate novel predictions about when territorial conflict is more or less likely to occur in international relations.

By utilizing the theory of domestic sources of international relations, this article argues that the MFA has been under stress from all directions: sidestepped by Party leaders from the top, challenged by competing ministries horizontally, and mocked by the public from below.

Growing Pains: Neoclassical Realism and Japan's Security Policy Emancipation.,"Saltzman, Ilai Z.",Contemporary Security Policy,15-Dec,Taylor & Francis Ltd,"POLITICAL realism; NATIONAL security; LIBERTY; INTERNATIONAL relations; JAPAN -- Foreign relations; ABE, Shinzo, 1954-",,"The rise of China has attracted considerable scholarly attention since the early 1990s. Recent developments in Japan leave no doubt, however, that close attention to Tokyo's changing foreign and security policy also is in order. In a break with tradition, the government of Prime Minister Shinzō Abe's approved in 2014 a new interpretation of Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution, facilitating the shift from basic self-defence to collective self-defence that allows Japan to assume greater regional and global security assertiveness and responsibility. This article examines the trajectory of Japan's security policy transformation, focusing on the causes and nature of this dramatic reorientation. By applying a neoclassical realist framework, the article traces the intricate interplay between shifts in Japan's strategic environment, domestic politics and the security policy decision-making process. Abe and the hawkism he represents will undoubtedly face Herculean hurdles in the future. Still, continued external challenges will inevitably force Tokyo to ‘normalize’ its security policy and shed off the remaining relics of its pacifism and anti-militarism. The article also concludes that the significant inducements driving Japanese security normalization are challenged by powerful domestic opposition. While the process will remain piecemeal rather than revolutionary, the course of Japan's security policy favours continued self-assertion, emancipation and reform.

Happy handover.,,International Journal,Spring2011,Sage Publications Inc.,INTERNATIONAL economic relations; BALANCE of power; INTERNATIONAL trade; GLOBALIZATION; HUMAN rights; MILITARY government; CHINA; UNITED States; CHINA-United States relations,,"The article offers opinions about international relations between the U.S. and China. The author offers observations on the U.S. resistance to economic and political decline, the economic relationship of trade and finance between the U.S. and China resulting from globalization, the lack of political and economic rights in China, and a potential military regime in China. It is suggested that due to increases in liberal economic policies and politics, the U.S. should hand over global leadership and power to China to model the approach that Great Britain took towards the U.S. after World War II."
Harmony with Diversity: China's Preferred World Order and Weakening Western Influence in the Developing World.,"van der Putten, Frans ‐ Paul",Global Policy,13-Feb,Wiley-Blackwell,EXPORTS; INTERNATIONAL relations; LIBERALISM; INTERNATIONAL organization; CHINA; DEVELOPING countries,,"The Chinese government says that it supports the notion of international diversity of political-economic systems. This should not be regarded as mere propaganda. Apart from a brief period during the Cultural Revolution, China never was interested in exporting its ideology or in trying to turn other countries into a replication of itself. It is unlikely that China will change its attitude in this regard, even as it emerges as a new superpower. On the contrary: as it becomes more influential at the multilateral level, it is likely that China will promote political-economic diversity as a major norm in international relations. This would limit the ability of the west to promote liberal democracy and economic liberalism through multilateral institutions, and perhaps even bilaterally. One of the effects of this process would be that the competitive advantage of Chinese companies in developing countries increases vis-à-vis western firms. This would accelerate the power shift in the developing world towards China from the west. Policy Implications In the years ahead China is likely to push international diversity as a major norm in international relations., China's drive towards international diversity challenges the western support for economic and political liberal values in international relations., The more China succeeds in making the institutions of global governance ideologically 'neutral' (i.e., not representing liberal values and thereby favouring the Chinese position vis-à-vis the west), the more difficult it becomes for the US and its western partners to use these institutions to export liberal democracy and economic liberalism to the developing world., It will be increasingly difficult for western firms to compete with their Chinese counterparts in developing countries. This strengthens Chinese economic - and therefore political - influence in the developing world vis-à-vis western influence.

Focusing on China's management of soft power over the past five years, the article distinguishes between the strategic and tactical levels to measure soft-power efficacy, with the strategic level judged to be more successful. Overall, China's policy has well served the interests of it and the world. As long as China perceives that the benefits of peaceful integration with the international system out- weigh the risks and costs of revisionist behavior, it will hold on to its policy of tapping soft power and continue on the course of a peaceful rise.

Hawk-Talk in Island Disputes: A Theoretical Analysis with an Application to Japan and Korea.,Shale Horowitz; Sunwoong Kim,Chinese Journal of International Politics,Winter2017,Oxford University Press / USA,PEACEFUL settlement of international disputes; NATIONAL security; INTERNATIONAL economic relations; IDEOLOGY; COOPERATION,,"The territory contested in island disputes is often of low intrinsic value from the national security and economic perspectives. This generally implies a stable status quo where both sides prefer peace to war. Yet island disputes commonly produce a variation whereby states engage in some degree of 'hawk-talk'--more or less confrontational rhetoric and related, symbolically important policies. Theoretically, hawk-talk should be more likely when the disputing countries have a strong, nationalistically salient history of conflict and less likely when they have high levels of cooperation in other national security areas or economic relations. Hawk-talk is expected to beget more hawk-talk, thus to increase the ideological and diversionary political value of assertiveness in island disputes, and to limit or reduce cooperation. Nationalistically salient histories of conflict amplified by hawk-talk can most easily be shown to raise the stakes and risks in low intrinsic value disputes. Yet such histories are expected to have an even greater potential impact on high intrinsic value disputes. We illustrate this logic by analysing the low-intrinsic-value dispute between Korea and Japan over the Dokdo/Takeshima Islands. Both the theory and the case study imply that cooperation in other areas does not constitute a reliable antidote to hawk-talk--driven dispute escalation. Countervailing national interest ideologies, which emphasise other objectives imperilled by dispute escalation, are the most promising complement to increased cooperation.

Hedging Against China: Japanese Strategy Towards A Rising Power.,"Vida, Ll. López; Pelegrín, Àngels",Asian Security,May-Aug2018,Taylor & Francis Ltd,NATIONAL security; INTERNATIONAL relations; CHINA-Japan relations,,"Debates about how states deal with rising powers have been mainly concentrated on a continuum comprising on balancing and bandwagoning strategies. While theory has principally offered realist and liberal explanations, Japanese behavior vis-à-vis China does not match with them. Japan is not powerful enough to balance against China but remains too strong to bandwagon. Accordingly, Tokyo is pursuing a mixed strategy of both containment and engagement, which may be better described as a hedging strategy against Beijing. This article analyzes which strategies states can adopt when dealing with a rising power and proposes a framework to analyze Japan's recent policy towards China based on Kuik's analysis. We argue that Japan's hedging strategy towards China is consistent with how middle-power states deal with rising power.

Hedging in South Asia: balancing economic and security interests amid Sino-Indian competition.,"Lim, Darren J; Mukherjee, Rohan",International Relations of the Asia-Pacific,19-Sep,Oxford University Press / USA,COLLATERAL security; NATIONAL security; INTERNATIONAL economic relations; CHINA-United States relations; HEDGING (Finance),,"The literature on hedging as a secondary state strategy – built largely on evidence from United States-China competition in East and Southeast Asia – focuses on conditions where a major power presents both an economic opportunity and a security threat. In South Asia, in contrast, secondary states facing strategic competition between India and China have pursued hedging strategies in the absence of a security threat. We develop a theoretical reconciliation of these two phenomena. Hedging at its core involves a trade-off between the material benefits and autonomy costs of cooperating with a major power in a competitive environment. States are likely to hedge when these benefits and costs are simultaneously rising. We test the plausibility of this theory in the cases of the Maldives and Sri Lanka. The autonomy trade-off operates both in the absence and in the presence of a security threat, thus offering a theoretical advancement with greater empirical scope.

These issues have existed for several decades, but they have not surfaced all the time. In the recent past, however, both China and Japan adopted policies that caused friction. Why did they do that? That is because of China's aggressive foreign policy based on the strong economy and Japan's rightwing shift for domestic political reason to appeal to nationalism. In addition, these countries adopted aggressive foreign policies to pursue national interests at the price of their neighboring states.

Nevertheless, the overwhelming emphasis on political thought, especially Confucianism, may have its drawbacks. This article suggests that political scientists who are interested in building theories and drawing policy implications should study the verifiable, i.e., history. Unless the purpose is to study philosophy for its own sake, political scientists should study political thought in practice, rather than political thought divorced from history. This article first discusses why it is important to examine history beyond thought. It then analyzes why scholars should not conflate political thought with historical practice. It anchors the analysis with a high-profile recent book on ancient Chinese thought.

As for the national views, (1) American perceptions of China have generally become more negative than Chinese perceptions of America; (2) little congruence is found between the two powers on key values and norms; and (3) perceptions are generally getting far ahead of the realities. As for the official views, formal documents do not fully reveal their real state of minds. Diplomatic courtesy and strategic self-esteem runs through them. Yet, America's strategic concern and growing will to manage China from a position of strength is increasingly more discernible. From the Chinese documents, on the other hand, signs of inferiority have gradually disappeared. In sum, perceptions between the two are working more as a catalyst for strategic competition than a constraint on it.

Actors vie for the attention of senior officials to promote their interests on any specific issue. As a result, decision making is often a slow process; there are multiple channels of information, and actors appeal to public opinion to support their claims. Since 2012, Xi Jinping has taken charge of all foreign policy related decision-making bodies in what appears to be an attempt to improve coordination of interest groups. A slight shift to a more personified foreign policy than during the Hu or Jiang eras has also taken place. In this paper, we describe how foreign policy decisions should be made in China according to formal rules; next, we take into account the reality of how the Chinese political system deals with China's evolving international role.
